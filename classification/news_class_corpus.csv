He received a resounding welcome from the crowd lined up along the streets and those watching the proceedings from their balconies. He waved at them from the sunroof of his customised SUV, which moved at a snail   s pace, and reached its destination a couple of hours late.   I have participated in many yatras but never experienced a flood of people like today in Kashi,    Mr. Modi later said at a rally at Kashi Vidyapeeth. He reiterated his commitment to develop Varanasi just like the    world imagines it to be   , and said that since the BJP came to power at the Centre, he had worked to improve the city   s infrastructure and ensure that its residents had their livelihood.Roads shabbyThe Prime Minister accused the Samajwadi Party government of deliberately not repairing the roads in the city after work on putting electric cables underground had been completed.    They fear Modi would get credit for the work,    he said.Mr. Modi accused the SP, the BSP and the Congress of fostering a culture of exclusive development unlike his call for Sabka Saath Sabka Vikaas .

The Navy is keen on an early decision to avoid Viraat meeting the same fate as its predecessor Vikrant, which eventually went to the scrapyard.MoD   s callResponding to a call from the Defence Ministry last year to all coastal States to put forward proposals on INS Viraat, A.P. has proposed to convert it into an offshore luxury hotel and build a Marina along with an entertainment zone around it. The proposal for joint development has already been communicated to Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar by A.P. Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu.In a follow up to this, Mr. Naidu, in February-end, had written to Urban Development Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu and Tourism Minister Mahesh Sharma for    in-principle    approval to set up the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) which would execute the project.World-class projectMr. Naidu has stated that his government intends to take forward the legacy of INS Viraat by making it a world-class project on the lines of other global projects like USS Alabama, USS Constellation, and HMS Belfast.   In view of above, your intervention is requested in giving an in-principle approval for setting up an SPV with a 50:50 sharing between the Government of India and the Government of Andhra Pradesh so as to take forward the prestigious and unique project at Visakhapatnam, which is fast becoming a prominent destination for foreign tourists,    Mr. Naidu requested the Union Ministers in the letters dated February 27.1,000-cr. projectThe overall project is expected to cost about Rs. 1,000 crore and is estimated to entail an annual maintenance of Rs. 150 crore.INS Viraat, weighing 27,800 tonnes, is the world   s oldest aircraft carrier in service. It had served in the British Navy as HMS Hermes for 25 years from November 1959 to April 1984 and after refurbishment, was commissioned into the Indian Navy in May 1987.The Navy had maintained Vikrant, India   s first aircraft carrier, at Mumbai for 17 years as various proposals to convert it into a museum went back and forth unsuccessfully before the ship was eventually sent to the scrapyard in 2014. The Navy has also stated that it cannot keep the Viraat indefinitely as it would block space in the dockyard.The Sea Harrier aircraft which flew off the deck of INS Viraat have already been withdrawn and the Navy   s 300 squadron which operated them has since inducted the newer multi-role Mig-29K fighter aircraft. Now the ship which had won the Royal British Navy the Falklands Wars against Argentina in 1982 awaits its fate.",national,Andhra Pradesh,Politics

I have spoken to Sardar Harpal Singh, father of the victim,    Ms. Swaraj tweeted, adding details about the bullet injury he sustained in his arm when a masked gunman opened fire at him outside his home, allegedly shouting,    Go back to your country.      Amb @NavtejSarna convyd r deep concerns to US Gov [Indian Ambassador Navtej Sarna conveyed deep concerns to the U.S. government] on recent tragic incidents involving Harnish Patel & Deep Rai,    the Indian Embassy in Washington tweeted.   Amb @NavtejSarna underlined need to prevent such incidents and protect Indian community.   Ascertaining crimeThe Ministry said the Indian Consulate in San Francisco was in    touch with local authorities who are ascertaining the nature of the crime   , though there is a suspicion of this being a hate crime, similar to the killing of an Indian engineer, Srinivas Kuchibhotla, in a bar in Kansas in February, which is now being investigated by the FBI.On Sunday, Ms. Swaraj said she had ensured that the Indian Consul had reached Lancaster, South Carolina, to meet the family of Harnish Patel, a convenience store owner who was killed as he was closing his shop for the day. As news of a third attack of a person of Indian origin in the U.S. spread, concern came in from other politicians as well.Punjab   s Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal urged Ms. Swaraj to    intervene in the matter and address the issue   , while West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee tweeted,    Two more shocking killings of Indians in the U.S. GOI (Government of India) must take this up with the U.S. government on an urgent basis.   Despite the pleas, however it is unclear what the Indian government can do, especially given that two of the men attacked are U.S. citizens.   Can   t be fixed easily      The problem is of intolerance and hate, and that is not something you can fix easily, in India or in the U.S,    says former Ambassador K.C. Singh.    Also the Modi government   s policy has been to treat the entire diaspora as one large entity, not distinguishing between Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) and Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), which can become a problem.   As a result, the Ministry is finding itself besieged by complaints from both categories, though there is little jurisdiction or official responsibility for India when it comes to U.S. citizens. Another problem that is emerging is the panic over all incidents involving citizens of Indian extraction being called racially motivated attacks.On Sunday, Ms. Swaraj fended off an enquiry from a gentleman appealing for help with his passport after the death of his nephew in Boston which, he wrote, seemed to be    one of those hate crimes   .   Our Consulate in New York has spoken to the father of the deceased in Massachusetts. He says this is a personal family tragedy,    Ms. Swaraj countered on Twitter, correcting him.The incident is, however, an indicator of the task cut out for the government over fears that hate crimes are allegedly on the rise because of the anti-immigration rhetoric of the Trump administration.(With PTI inputs)",national,Delhi,Politics

In Delhi to clear files, Mr. Singh took time out to speak to The Hindu at his 17 Akbar Road residence. Excerpts:How easy or difficult are elections in Uttar Pradesh for the BJP this time?It   s easy, not difficult at all because BJP will not only get a majority but an absolute majority.On what basis are you saying it   s an easy contest? People say it   s a difficult one.We are getting tremendous support. According to me, it   s unexpected. I wasn   t expecting this kind of support. We have fulfilled expectations and will match it with 2014 performance. Whether it   s the Prime Minister or the Central government, there has been no credibility loss. Nobody has put a question mark on the intentions of this government. Big decisions were taken and demonetisation was one of them. The Opposition was up in arms against demonetisation and they expected it will benefit them, but common people have supported us. For some time, people were troubled. You must have seen the television interviews of people standing in queues outside the ATMs, but they never questioned the intention of the PM or the government. Nobody put a question mark on it.What kind of response did you get for demonetisation in the public meetings you addressed?I will tell you, during huge meetings, when I asked the public about their response to demonetisation during my public meetings, people raised their hands in support.If demonetisation is not an issue according to BJP, then why did you raise this matter during your public meetings?No, no I didn   t raise it. We seldom raised the issue of notebandi among public only when someone in Opposition created a furore. It was not required.Do you think the government should have been better prepared for notebandi?You must have seen the CSO   s [Central Statistical Organisation   s] data; they have pegged the GDP growth at 7% and it projected a growth of 7.1%. First, there was an apprehension that GDP will come down, it didn   t happen. I was reading the statement of World Bank CEO; she has also said the same thing.Economists have raised concerns about the quality of the data.There could be a difference of opinion; it   s natural. I saw Mr. [P] Chidambaram   s statement; Congress should oppose it.What are the other issues in the election?The main issues are good governance and development.The BJP has a proven track record of development and good governance. Had it not been so then BJP would have lost its credibility.Is it the strength of the government or the weakness of the Opposition?No it   s the strength of the government.But the Opposition is fragmented   The Congress used to be a national opposition party, not any more. For a healthy democracy, there should be a strong Opposition.How do you view the Congress challengein U.P.?Congress has lost its credibility among the masses. They have ruled for a long period and they couldn   t fulfil the basic needs of people. Even today, the percentage of literacy in Congress-ruled States is quite low, poverty has increased, and infrastructure like roads, electricity, water is not there.What is your view of the role of    dynasty    in politics?I don   t think dynasty is a big issue, but it is true that members of one family keep replacing each other in the hierarchy. I believe that a politician   s son should work for the party for at least 10 years, if not more, and then if he wants to come [into politics], he can. You cannot stop anyone.Why do you oppose Rahul Gandhi on the dynasty front then?Me, then my son, after that his son, this is what dynasty politics is about.Who is your main opponent in U.P.?It   s difficult to decide this. BJP is contesting all seats. Some places it   s the Samajwadi Party, in around 10 seats some small parties are there. I think BJP has moved towards absolute majority.Will the family feud in the SP benefit Akhilesh Yadav?I don   t want to get into family politics; it   s their personal matter. I don   t become happy if there is a rift in any family. I don   t even want to know the reasons [behind the feud]. But it is also true that within two years of coming to power, SP started losing its credibility. The expectations people had from SP were not fulfilled.Bharat jaise desh ka temperament, log chahhte hain politician seasoned hona chahiye, mature hona chahiye, well experienced hona chahiye . (As far as I know of India   s temperament, people want a seasoned, mature and experienced chief minister).What about the BSP challenge?The BSP is not a challenge. The BSP and the SP-Congress are fighting a losing battle.Are the BJP   s references to shamshaan (cremation ground) and kabristan (graveyard) an attempt to consolidate Hindu votes?The Prime Minister   s statement has been misinterpreted. His purpose was to highlight the discrimination on the basis of caste, creed and religion. That is why we believe in sabka saath sabka vikaas. And if you think that our political ideology is cultural nationalism, then it is the culture of India as espoused by sages and saints; Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam , the whole world is a family.How does that sit with your development plank?Development is obstructed when you discriminate on the basis of caste, creed and religion. In a diverse country like India, you have to take everyone along.Doesn   t the PM   s statement on kabristans have a communal undertone?It   s a wrong perception; the PM is entirely secular.But your party did not give the ticket to a single Muslim candidate.In Manipur, we have given ticket to several candidates, including Muslims and Christians. Actually, they would have decided this on the basis of    winnability   . We didn   t deliberately not give the [party] ticket to Muslim candidates; Muslims are citizens of this country, so are Christians.But all political parties do give preference to caste   We also look at    winnability   ; we do consider social equations. If a person belonging to any caste doesn   t win, then what is the point?BJP has written to the EC to check women in burqas at polling booths?I am not aware of the letter.You are considered the BJP   s tallest leader in U.P. In case the BJP wins, will you become the Chief Minister?I already have a responsibility; I should not speak on this as I am a member of the Central Parliamentary Board, which has to take the decision on the process to be adopted to elect the leader of the legislature party.If not you, then who?The Parliamentary board will decide this.Is there a shortlist?Everything is done there [at the Parliamentary board]. We have not projected any CM candidate; there are many leaders.Has not having a CM face affected your prospects?I don   t think so. You must have seen this in Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Maharashtra     we did not project anyone. There is no particular formula.There are reports of clashes between RSS and Left parties in Kerala. Does this concern you as Home Minister?It is natural that I am concerned. I have requested the Kerala CM several times to stop this violence and he should put an end to it. I have spoken to him in person as well. He has assured me that he will do his best.Why don   t you make the Naga accord public?Whatever is there in the accord, let me assure you that it will not affect the territorial integrity of any State.

In an email exchange between by Umang Vohra, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Cipla Pharmaceuticals, and patient-activist Loon Gangte, Mr. Vohra states that,    Cipla has always stood for the patients     not just in India but also all per the World (sic). Quite naturally, we also expect that issues regarding payments are also addressed expeditiously,    indicating that Cipla will not move from its stand until either Global Fund or the Indian government settles the bills.The heated three-way communication between Cipla, the Indian government and the HIV community ended on March 4, with an email being marked to the entire top brass of Cipla Pharmaceuticals, Indian government officials and Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) with Mr. Loon Gangte, making it clear that he was    in no position    to guarantee payments. Mr. Gangte writes that he had    been told by officials in Cipla that we should ensure payment for any future procurement of the medicine from Cipla. I would like to tell you that the community is in no position to do so. We can neither force the government nor donors like the Global Fund. But at the end of the day, we are the ones who are hit by these shortages and stock-outs.   Experts say the critical shortages are proving to be both tragic and embarrassing for India   s HIV programme.    The government is abdicating its constitutional responsibility to make available life saving medicines for the HIV community. It is also unfortunate that the present management of Cipla is walking away from its commitment to access to medicines all over the world, for which they are globally renowned,    said Anand Grover, Senior Counsel at Lawyers Collective   s HIV/AIDS Unit.For the HIV-infected children, the letter to Mr. Modi, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Health Minister JP Nadda is a last resort.    We humbly request you to look into the matter of HIV drug stock out, in general, and in particular paediatric HIV medicines to ensure that they are not merely exported but also actually available to the children in this country.",national,Maharashtra,Health

Is a deep state at work to steal Digital India?   , the article on Aadhaar published in his Web magazine, Inclusion , on February 11, included a video of how unauthorised transactions are being done by misusing stored biometrics. The Delhi police registered an FIR against him under the newly implemented Aadhaar Act for spreading rumours.In an e-mail response to The Hindu , Mr. Kochhar said:    I have only done my patriotic duty by writing a story on the vulnerability in the Aadhaar system, based on the inputs and evidence received. If this is a crime, FIRs would have to be filed against everyone in the media.    He said the police were yet to contact him.    I have not been informed that there is an FIR against me,    he said.Corrective actionMr. Kochhar said the video evidence that he posted was sent by a person.   Subsequently, the UIDAI issued a notice to that person, clearly stating that he has indeed successfully done transactions using stored biometrics which is illegal. Subsequently, they also announced new steps on hardware encryption of Aadhaar data and also suspended the licences of some entities. So much of action has happened after my expose, that shows that the UIDAI has not only accepted the vulnerability but is also working overtime to take corrective action to make Aadhaar more secure. The electronic trail of the video evidence for the story is available with us. No one has sought that yet,    he said.He said he had shared his concern with all relevant government officials, including the UIDAI, through mails, confidential communication and social media, and despite this, an FIR was filed against him.    Well, I have pointed to the loopholes ... What is intriguing though, is a large number of media reports on an FIR against me that I have not even seen. This does come across as an attempt to malign and intimidate me into silence, by who? I cannot say,    he said.Mr. Kochhar said he was a reform historian and a policy wonk related to digital, financial and social inclusion. He has authored Modinomics , a book detailing the development model of Gujarat under Prime Minister Narendra Modi.   I have published 18 books so far, including on subjects like Aadhaar, cyber security etc. The government has been supportive of my work and quite a few reform initiatives have been influenced by my work. I have been supportive of Aadhaar and have described it as a way to Digital Deliverance in my last book.

http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/aadhaar-data-not-misused-uidai/article17414731.ece,"Dismissing reports of misuse of Aadhaar biometrics for identity or financial thefts, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) on Sunday said personal data held by it were secure.   There has been no incident of misuse of Aadhaar biometrics leading to identity theft and financial loss during the past five years when more than 400 crore Aadhaar authentication transactions have taken place,    an official statement said.Recently, a breach of Aadhaar data was reported after the UIDAI sent a notice to three firms for possible unauthorised authentication attempt and storing of biometric data. The notice it had served was shared widely on social media and questions were raised over the safety of Aadhaar data.Describing the incident as an    isolated case of an employee working with a bank   s business correspondents    company   , the authority said the employee had attempted to misuse his own biometrics. This was detected by the UIDAI internal security system and subsequently action under the Aadhaar Act was initiated.The UIDAI said it had    carefully gone into these reports   , and asserted that the    Aadhaar system has the capability to inquire into any instance of misuse of biometrics and identity theft and initiate action. UIDAI uses one of the world   s most advanced encryption technologies in transmission and storage of data. As a result, during the past seven years, there has been no report of breach or leak of residents    data out of UIDAI.   Further, the authority said it continuously updated the security parameters and undertook security audits.Criminal offenceOn reports that there were no extant regulations to prevent storage and misuse of e-KYC data, the UIDAI clarified that there were    stringent provisions in the Aadhaar (Authentication) Regulations governing the usage of e-KYC data, including storage and sharing, resident consent being paramount in both the cases.    Any unauthorised capture of iris or fingerprint data or storage or replay of biometrics or their misuse is a criminal offence under the Aadhaar Act.Further, addressing concerns over private agencies hired by mobile operators and banks for e-KYC leading to creation of parallel database, the statement said Aadhaar authentication or e-KYC was only available to authorised agencies whose appointment, responsibilities and statutory obligations, and penal provisions for contraventions were clearly provided for in the Aadhaar Act and the regulations.Customer consent   Banks or mobile operators have to become UIDAI   s authentication user agencies and authentication service agencies to obtain e-KYC data of their customers from the UIDAI. The e-KYC data can be given by the UIDAI to these agencies only after they obtain consent of their customers and can be used only for the purpose for which it was obtained,    it said.   Violations of the provisions attract strict penalties under the Aadhaar Act which will be enforced strictly,    the statement said.More than 111 crore people have Aadhaar in India, covering more than 99% of the adult population. According to official data, more than 4.47 crore people have opened bank accounts using Aadhaar e-KYC.Aadhaar has helped the government transfer LPG subsidy under the PAHAL scheme, MGNREGS payments, scholarships and pensions directly into the accounts of beneficiaries eliminating diversion and leakage of funds by middlemen. The direct benefits transfer has saved the government Rs. 49,000 crore during two-and-a-half years, the release added.",national,India,Others

The festival     organised by Vishwa Samvad Kendra, the media wing of the RSS     is expected to be held in April.Each film will have a running time of 10 minutes, including opening and closing titles. There will be a panel of judges to select the winners in the categories of fiction, non-fiction, animation, drama and docudrama.    We are also considering financial rewards for the winners,    the sources said.RSS functionaries said one of the primary objectives was to remind Bengal   s people of the    true Indian ethos as it is not projected in mainstream films.

The women only agree to speak because they trust an accompanying activist from the only NGO in Russia for sex workers called Serebryanaya Roza, or Silver Rose. The activist, Regina Akhmetzyanova, spends her evening going to such clandestine brothels to give out condoms and to offer sex workers an HIV test.This is particularly important for prostitutes since infection rates in Russia are currently growing, with more than 1,03,000 new cases identified in 2016, up 5% on the previous year, while the real total is likely to be significantly higher.Legal ban   Russian prostitutes are absolute [outcasts] who have no real way of defending themselves,    says Silver Rose   s founder, Irina Maslova. Ms. Maslova (in her 40s) says she spent six years selling sex in the city before becoming an activist in 2003 and one of the few public advocates for prostitutes    rights.While prostitution is illegal in Russia, it is punishable by a fine of just 1,500 rubles ($26). Activists say this legal ban is often used by police as an excuse not to investigate crimes against sex workers. Ms. Maslova believes that only legalisation of prostitution can bring an end to the abuses against the women and aims to create what she calls a    trade union for sex workers   .There seems little prospect of this currently as officials and lawmakers back conservative policies and stress the importance of fidelity in HIV prevention campaigns.In Saint Petersburg, activists estimate there could be between 4,000 and 6,000 women who earn their living from prostitution.

http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/policy-drags-ecommerce-exports/article17414664.ece,"India had woken up to the huge potential of e-commerce exports when the Centre decided to provide incentives in the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2015-20 to promote exports of goods hosted on a website and dispatched through courier or postal mode.However, exporters have now identified several    restrictions    under the FTP and related norms as    challenges    that are preventing them from maximising the potential of e-commerce exports.The FTP incentives for e-commerce exports are only for low-value goods       falling in the category of handloom products, books and periodicals, leather footwear, toys and customised fashion garments, having free-on-board value up to Rs. 25,000 per consignment and finalised using the e-commerce platform.   The payment for goods purchased on e-commerce platform shall be done through international credit or debit cards and as per the Reserve Bank of India norms.According to an assessment with the Commerce Ministry and the apex body for exporters in the country     the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO)     there are more than 25,000 Indian companies, small and medium firms and entrepreneurs present on the American multinational e-commerce company eBay alone, exporting their items directly to the consumers across the world.B2C exportersIt is estimated that there are more than two lakh such Indian business-to-consumer (B2C) exporters making use of their own websites or other e-commerce platforms and social media sites.According to FIEO, there is a market opportunity of about $5 billion in the near-term, say in the next 2-3 years, for Indian e-commerce retail exports provided the concerns of such exporters are addressed expeditiously by the government.Since a survey had pointed out that those selling their items using eBay employ about 6.5 employees on an average, further promotion of Indian e-commerce exports is also expected to lead to greater direct and indirect employment generation.There is intense competition in the e-commerce exports space, and several countries are actively promoting e-commerce exports. For instance, the U.K. government   s Department for International Trade (DIT) has an    E-Exporting Programme    to help U.K. companies sell their products or services overseas through e-commerce.According to the U.K. government   s website, the programme enables U.K. companies to to get expert international trade advice and support through a free meeting with DIT e-commerce advisers. The programme also helps U.K. companies to develop and implement an international e-commerce strategy, as well as to    set up on e-marketplaces and identify new e-marketplaces around the world to sell through, with the DIT   s    Selling online overseas    tool.   It also enables U.K. companies to    access better than commercial rates to list on some e-marketplaces, including lower commission fees and    try for free    periods.   India   s e-commerce retail exporters are also facing major competition from their counterparts in China and South Asia. According to the World Trade Organisation, in 2015, e-commerce in goods and services was worth about $22 trillion globally, and has grown the fastest in emerging economies.As per India   s FTP 2015-20, the incentives for e-commerce exports are under the Merchandise Export from India Scheme (MEIS). The rewards are in the form of freely transferable duty credit scrips (that gives duty benefits for imports of inputs / import of goods including capital goods / domestic procurement of inputs and goods including capital goods, etc).The FTP, however, states that    if the value of exports using e-commerce platform is more than Rs. 25,000 per consignment, then MEIS reward would be limited to free-on-board value of Rs. 25,000 only.   It adds that    such goods can be exported in manual mode through Foreign Post Offices at New Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai. Export of such goods under Courier Regulations shall be allowed manually on pilot basis through airports at Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai as per appropriate amendments in regulations to be made by Department of Revenue.    The FTP further says that the Department of Revenue shall fast track the implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) mode at courier terminals.   Raise incentives   According to the exporters, though e-commerce is a great medium for them to expand their product lines, the FTP currently limits incentives to just a handful of items, thereby restricting the growth of Indian exporters using the e-commerce mode.They said the list of items for incentives should be expanded to include jewellery, which is among the biggest finished product exports from India, as well as health & beauty items, auto spare parts and musical instruments.Also, in order to promote exports from the country   s micro, small and medium enterprises through e-commerce, the value limit for availing MEIS benefits should be enhanced up to Rs. 5 lakh from the current level of Rs. 25,000 per consignment.In addition, they pointed out that the clearance process under the MEIS scheme is currently manual and not EDI-enabled. Therefore, it is necessary to open EDI-based clearance for e-commerce export categories including leather, apparel, home-d  cor, ayurveda, organic food, sports goods and fashion jewellery.Besides, they said, through their apex body FIEO, that the application fee was too high for e-commerce exports to avail benefits under MEIS. For instance, if an exporter currently exports four consignments each worth Rs. 25,000 for a product attracting 2% duty benefit under MEIS, he gets a benefit of Rs. 2,000 (for a total export of Rs. 1 lakh). But on that amount, he has to pay an application fee of Rs. 1,000, thereby reducing the actual benefits.   The fee may be reduced substantially or waived off to give encouragement to this new and emerging mode of exports,    the FIEO said.A major disincentive is that currently, when a buyer sends an item back to an e-commerce exporter, import duty is charged. However, in the case of exports other than through the e-commerce route, customs duties are exempted on return of exported goods.Therefore, exporters feel that unless return of goods is exempted from customs tariff, e-commerce retail exports will not take off in India in a big way.Also, there is no provision for    commercial shipment    in the forms provided by Customs in Foreign Post Office of India Post.The options currently available are only    gift   ,    sample   ,    documents   ,    commercial samples    and    others   . Most customs authorities are reluctant to allow e-commerce exports under the    others   -category.Small-value shipmentsThe exporters also said presently, the Courier Shipping Bill (CSB-II) did not support commercial small-value, single-item shipment. The Bill only supports gifts or samples, and has no provision for    commercial shipments   . Besides, the CSB   II is highly cumbersome as it has multiple fields and requires lots of information to be furnished even for low-value shipments, the FIEO said.   The exporter is also unable to claim any FTP or tax input related benefits if he wishes to do so,    it said, suggesting that a new CSB form be introduced and notified at the earliest.Another difficulty being faced by e-commerce exporters is that such exports through India Post or via the commercial courier mode are ticked as    samples    or    gifts    and not as    Commercial Shipment   . Therefore, such documents are not    recognised    or    acknowledged    by Value Added Tax (VAT) authorities, despite proof of receipt of foreign exchange through bank realisation certificate.This leads to a situation where VAT and service tax are not refunded in such cases of e-commerce exports as there are no Custom-stamped documents in such cases to prove    Commercial Shipment   , thereby reducing the competitiveness of Indian products. Also, an irritant is the requirement of multiple copies of invoice, making the export clearance process for a seller via the e-commerce export route difficult, expensive, paper-centric and time-consuming especially in a technology-enabled environment, according to FIEO.   Sellers need to sign and attach multiple physical documents and pay a commercial clearance charge of Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 1200 for every shipment,    said Ajay Sahai, director-general and CEO, FIEO.    A single-product shipment via private courier requires seven copies of invoices (self-declaration), while India Post requires three copies of invoices (self-declaration),    Mr. Sahai added.",business,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/where-safety-supersedes-everything-else/article17414666.ece,"In a culture steeped in pride in breaking rules in daily life, be they traffic regulations or safety laws, how do you get people to comply inside a factory? In a place that compresses 250 tonnes of steel a day     steel that turns into a car in about four hours, steel that churns out cars at the rate of about 90 per hour     Senthil Kumar R.M. has his task cut out.As head of health & safety at Hyundai Motor India, it is Mr. Kumar   s job to ensure that the close to 11,000 people who work at the carmaker   s Chennai factory help churn out automobiles without danger to limb or life.    The indirect reward for breaking rules is high in the minds of people,    according to Mr. Kumar.    If a worker can fix a problem in an assembly line without having to stop production, he does not have to go through a hierarchy of explanation to detail what happened.    In other words, quick fixes save time.But they also endanger lives.    It happens across the industry and not just one company.   He refers to the case of a worker, in a competitor   s factory, investigating an unidentified object in the line. It is learnt that the worker, who was himself a supervisor in the know of rules, and trained to switch off the assembly line in case of emergency, did not do so and was fatally sucked into the machine.   If a supervisor permits a subordinate to circumvent rules to save time and cost, it neither calls for appreciation nor is it to be ignored. The team needs to be pulled up.   Grievous injuryMr. Kumar put it succinctly when he said,    Ninety-nine times out of 100 that one breaks rules, nothing happens. But the once an injury occurs, it is grievous.    And that is one too many, in his view. What kind of accidents can occur in a car factory?    Not wearing arm sleeves or gloves while lifting heavy material could lead to deep gashes. Getting into the sweeping arc of a robot without switching off the machine could lead to major injury.    Jaywalking on the shop floor can lead to accidents with vehicles that transport material. Incidents could include fire due to negligence. For instance, a casual labourer had once left thinner material in a hot environment while leaving for lunch.Sparks from a nearby robot had led to a minor fire. In 2008, another fire had led to the breakdown of a robot in the paint shop. Mr. Kumar said,    There were two robots doing the top coat of paint. Since a robot doing the primer job was out of action due to fire, we had to use the top-coat robot for the primer job.    This, obviously, led to productivity loss.Mr. Kumar   s team focuses on educating staff and relentless communication with them to get safety to be top priority for workers across all levels in the company. He said that doing so also helped the message seep into other aspects of their lives as well as those of their family members.Using both lead as well as lag indicators, the safety team has come up with a composite figure called the safety index.    From the managing director downwards, every one   s performance is measured as per the index.   Lead indicators that contribute to the index are the behavioural changes that the safety department has brought in.   The number of near misses that could have potentially caused damage, training programmes conducted, improvements to safety in an assembly line are all lead indicators.    Lag indicators obviously stem from actual incidents or accidents that happen, the number of man-days lost due to injury, medical expenses and productivity lost due to stoppage of a production line.   Safety, not savings!   Asked if his team had helped save on costs, Mr. Kumar said,    Our aim is to ensure safety, not save on costs.   But cost savings are collateral benefits.   The number of incidents of injury to personnel dropped 30% compared with last year, and about 70% compared with 2008.    The company   s expenses on premium paid against fire insurance had also dropped in relative terms. While the sum assured against fire, which runs into several thousand crores every year, has gone up 50% since 2011, the premium paid has risen at a lesser rate, going just above 40%. Hyundai Motor also has apprentices coming in to work, fresh out of training institutes. They may not have been exposed to environments with a strict culture for safety. In other words, not complying with rules has typically not evoked punishments in their earlier lives.   These are barriers to becoming safety-conscious,    said Mr. Kumar. This necessitates continuous messaging.The safety department at Hyundai has also appointed 77 safety ambassadors handpicked from each shop     assembly, body and paint shops.    They are trained to be communicators and role models,    according to Mr. Kumar.Further, areas across the factory are earmarked as being the responsibility of a set of such ambassadors with their photos displayed prominently.    This brings a sense of ownership in maintaining safety and cleanliness in those areas.   To guard against damage from fire, the safety department has also trained about seven teams in handling fire. Each team has about six to seven members and each of the three daily shifts is designed to have one such team working.   Every member is trained across one of three functions: to put out a fire, to supply material such as extinguishers to the fire-handling team or to move property to safety and to communicate to the management or fire departments in an emergency.   If a member is not in any of these three functions, he or she is trained to get to a safe assembly point quickly for the customary headcount.Using both lead as well as lag indicators, our team has come up with a composite figure called the safety index that helps track our performanceSenthil Kumar R.M.Head, Health & Safety, Hyundai Motor IndiaUsing both lead as well as lag indicators, our team has come up with a composite figure called the safety index that helps track our performanceSenthil Kumar R.M.Head, Health & Safety, Hyundai Motor India",business,,

Some markets like Abu Dhabi has invested and received pre-clearance facility for early immigration clearance in the U.S. There are some advantages to that and that   s part of the conversation ongoing with the Indian government as well,    said Fred Dixon, president and CEO, NYC and Company, New York   s official tourism and marketing organisation.   They are also talking about expanding the Global Entry program for frequent Indian travellers to the U.S. to enable them to have faster access at the border. That   s under discussion and these are very tactical ideas to improve access and transit between the two countries,    Mr. Dixon told The Hindu .The New York Metropolitan Authority area is home to the largest Indian population within the U.S., he pointed out. Mr. Dixon was part of an official US delegation to New Delhi led by the US Department of Commerce   s National Travel and Tourism Office as part of the US   India strategic and commercial dialogue   s travel and tourism working group.About 1.1 million Indians visited the U.S. in 2015 and spent close to $12 billion, making it the seventh-largest market for U.S. travel and tourism exports. Over the last decade, travel and tourism exports to India have more than doubled and now account for 65% of U.S. services exports to India, and U.S. Commerce Department expects a further 72% growth in arrivals from India by 2021.

http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/law-enforcement-in-the-digital-era/article17414667.ece,"One consequence of the recent demonetisation was a push towards the digitisation of the economy     a move that will create transparency in the financial system.But this digital push must be accompanied by greater security of digital transactions to deal with the tsunami of cybercrimes that is bound to follow. India   s enforcement mechanisms, laws and policies must be re-examined immediately to ensure that the theft of data or money is dealt with severely, swiftly and transparently.A recent ASSOCHAM-PwC study found that cybercrime in India surged almost 300% between 2011 and 2014. The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), the national agency tasked with maintaining cybersecurity, reported more than 50,000 security incidents in 2015. With the push towards digital transactions, this number will only grow. As smartphones become the preferred mode of transactions, hacking, phishing and malware based attacks are serious concerns. The Nokia malware report showed a 96% surge in mobile device infections in 2016.The logistical burden these incidents will place on law-enforcement the judiciary, will be enormous. Our police infrastructure, which doesn   t yet have the capacity to handle existing cybercrimes, will be strained to breaking point in the coming surge.Dealing with cyber offences necessarily means upgrading the capabilities of law enforcement, either through new recruitment or by imparting technical training to existing personnel. But this prescription comes with its own problems, not least being the supply of qualified people.Given the salaries and perquisites in the public services vis-a-vis the private sector, hiring qualified people will be difficult. A differential pay structure or fast-track promotions will be problematic in the current system, which is strictly hierarchical. If existing personnel are trained rigorously, on the other hand, there is the danger that they will be poached by the private sector.The more promising option is a Public Private Partnership (PPP) to combat cybercrime. Such a partnership will draw upon the skills in the private sector to train the police, while providing practical experience in dealing with cybercrimes to corporate employees. Such models already exist and are fairly successful.One example is the National Cyber Forensic Training Alliance (NCFTA) in the U.S., a non-profit platform that tackles cybercrime through partnerships with subject matter experts in the public, private, and academic sectors. A similar set-up in India is the NASSCOM-affiliated Data Security Council of India (DSCI). The DSCI sets up cyberlabs in different cities and imparts training. This model is now ripe for scale-up across the country and can be tapped into by the jurisdictional police.In addition, we must reshape our current cybercrime laws to address the likely surge in offences relating to digitisation. Given the borderless nature of cybercrimes, state police agencies need to be able to pursue offenders without worrying about jurisdiction. To allow for this, a pan-India cyber-enforcement force must be considered.Such a force can become a one-stop-shop for digital monetary fraud and will go a long way in assuaging the concerns of cyber-fraud victims. Such a force will also be able to identify trends and stop entities that prey on the gullibility of uninformed citizens transitioning to the digital economy.(The views of Pronab Mohanty, IPS, DDG-UIDAI and Jai Asundi, Research Coordinator, CSTEP are personal)Public-private partnership is critical to training the policePublic-private partnership is critical to training the police",business,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/small-businesses-lobby-for-rules-to-increase-liquidity/article17414660.ece,"Close to five years after the introduction of a separate segment for listing of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), market participants are now looking at ways to increase the liquidity to attract more institutional and retail investors.With critical mass being attained, market participants are now lobbying hard with the capital market regulator to review the trading norms to increase liquidity in the segment. One of the main issues being proposed is lowering the trading lot size post listing, which is currently pegged at Rs. 1 lakh.Minimum lot size refers to the minimum amount that an investor has to put in to trade in the shares of a company.Separate platformsThe country   s leading equity bourses     BSE and the National Stock Exchange (NSE)     introduced their separate SME platforms in 2012. While both have been pitching their respective platforms to SMEs by way of awareness camps across the country, BSE has marched ahead in terms of numbers of companies. Asia   s oldest stock exchange has seen 165 SMEs listing on its segment, while NSE has close to 60 entities on board so far.   There is marked improvement in trades in SME stocks, though many a time, concerns over lesser liquidity still take centre-stage in discussions on SME investing,    says Mahavir Lunawat, Group Managing Director, Pantomath Capital, an investment banking entity specialising in the SME space.   Mitigation of lot size in secondary trades can be explored as a measure to aid liquidity levels. Investors would certainly find it more convenient to deal in SME stocks in small lots. That will also reduce pressure on market makers,    adds Mr. Lunawat.Merchant bankers are of the view that once the company has been listed for a certain period of time and a trading history has been created, the lot size could be lowered to one share so that retail investors can also participate if they are convinced with the quality and potential of the entity.SEBI proposalIncidentally, a formal proposal on behalf of Association of Investment Bankers of India (AIBI), the umbrella body of merchant bankers, is likely to be submitted soon to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).Stock exchanges, however, seem to differ over the issue of lowering the lot size. While NSE favours a reduction in lot size post listing, BSE believes that the current framework has worked well and hence should not be changed.   SEBI has made the SME guidelines for informed investors and it is working fine. There is no need to disturb the ecosystem at this juncture,    said Ajay Thakur, Head BSE SME.When SEBI framed the guidelines for the SME segment, it intentionally kept the minimum trading lot at Rs. 1 lakh to keep out retail investors since the view was that SMEs carry higher risk compared to companies on the main board.   SEBI has been consulting the market on this issue and reducing the lot size is likely to improve liquidity in securities on the SME platform. It can be considered if the regulator thinks it is appropriate,    said a senior NSE official.Bankers say that the last five years have shown that there is enough appetite for SME stocks and investors have realised that the segment is for investment and not trading for quick gains.   Given that most of the SMEs are at the initial trajectory of the business life cycle, investors should have a longer investment horizon. The SME segment should not be perceived to be a trading platform aimed at making immediate returns,    said Mr. Lunawat.",business,,

Moreover, a traveller has to be present in person at these offices with all the travel documents.In a notification issued on December 31, the RBI had said that a facility for exchange of these notes had been made available for resident and non-resident citizens who could not avail the facility from November 10 to December 30, 2016 on account of their absence from India in the period.While this facility will remain open for residents (who were abroad during the specified period) from January 2, 2017 to March 31, 2017, NRIs can avail this till June 30, 2017.However, this facility will be made available through only five of the offices of the RBI at Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, and Nagpur.While there is no monetary limit for exchange for the eligible Resident Indians, the limit for NRIs will be as per the relevant FEMA Regulations, which allows an NRI to carry only a maximum of Rs. 25,000 abroad,Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) and Persons of Indian Origin (PIO), who are not Indian citizens, are not eligible for this facility.Immigration stampA copy of the passport with immigration stamp as proof of the individual   s absence from the country during the period November 9, 2016 to December 30, 2016 should be submitted.

Bhagya PrakashOften on Sunday, Virat Kohli gesticulated to the crowd. The message was clear: make some noise. The fans at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium responded heartily and some took it to an extreme level and even booed departing Australian batsmen.Yet, for all the off-field drama, it was Steve Smith   s men who progressed on the turf and gained an unfinished 48-run lead.At close on the second day of the second Test, Australia had posted 237 for six in its first innings, well past India   s 189.The run-rate at times was excruciatingly slow, plumbing below two, especially in the morning session. There were edges that fell short, a few nerve-wracking moments as India pressed for reviews only to eat humble pie and in this chaos, Australia stood firm.A large share of the credit is due to opener Matt Renshaw (60, 196b, 5x4, 1x6) and Shaun Marsh (66, 197b, 4x4).Early strikeResuming at the overnight 40 for no loss on a wearing pitch, Australia needed David Warner to prosper. The opener, though, played beside the line to R. Ashwin and found his stumps in disarray.At 52 for one, Australia looked up to Renshaw and Smith to stay. The former did that while the latter was caught up in a    making-faces    tussle with Ishant Sharma. It did not make for pretty viewing and Smith eventually fell to Ravindra Jadeja.Seemingly oblivious to the pressure around him, Renshaw dug in. He enjoyed a lucky break on 29 as Kohli could not latch onto an edge off Umesh Yadav. Along with fellow southpaw Shaun, Renshaw guided Australia to 87 for two at lunch.On resumption, the duo stretched a critical 52-run partnership across 151 deliveries. If the first session was about being dour against accurate Indian bowlers, the secondary period revealed a relative urgency from the visitors.Smith   s men scored 76 for three in the 35 overs between lunch and tea. Kohli persisted with the ploy of speedsters from the Northern End and spinners at the Pavilion End.The predictability of that approach emboldened Renshaw and Shaun Marsh to unveil their sweeps, pulls and the hoick into the stands.Finally in the day   s 47th over, Kohli employed spin from the Northern End, pressing Jadeja into service. Initially Renshaw remained guarded but in Jadeja   s next over, he smote a six; but in trying for an encore, the opener was left stranded as the left-arm spinner fired down the leg-side to set up a stumping.After Renshaw   s exit, Australia lost two more before tea as Peter Handscomb found a diving Ashwin, who pulled off a splendid catch within the inner circle. On the stroke of tea, Mitchell Marsh failed to block an Ishant delivery that kept low and homed into his legs.Productive last sessionAt 163 for five and staying just 16 runs adrift off India   s first innings total, it was Australia that held a marginal edge, an advantage that was reinforced in the last session as 74 were scored in 26 overs, with Shaun Marsh   s exit being the lone blip.It was a passage of play in which India, striving hard to nip the tail, found Shaun Marsh surviving an lbw appeal from Umesh. The review favoured the Australian and fittingly his single, off Ashwin, helped his team secure the lead.Shaun Marsh, who had earlier feathered a snick off Umesh but India had not asked for a review, added 57 runs for the sixth-wicket with Matthew Wade, before succumbing to a persevering Umesh. The joy for India was fleeting and there was more misery in store.Wriddhiman Saha dropped Mitchell Starc off Umesh with the left-hander yet to open his account. Memories of his biff in the first innings at Pune are still fresh.",sports,India,Cricket

http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indias-inexperience-with-review-system-exposed/article17414763.ece,"For long, India   s response to the Decision Review System was complete disengagement. Then under a new captain-coach combination, it decided to embrace the technology.It started rather well as India did better than its opponents, both in the five-Test series against England and the one-off Test against Bangladesh.However, the Pune Test exposed India   s inexperience when it came to using the system. It sought seven reviews but was successful only once.Of the six it lost, three did not even return umpire   s call, a clear indication of how wishful the thinking behind them was.On the second day of the second Test against Australia here, India   s troubles continued unabated. There were three reviews and all of them wrong. Only one returned umpire   s call when R. Ashwin challenged Nigel Llong   s decision to not declare skipper Steven Smith out leg before.   We have been working on it,    said Cheteshwar Pujara.    At times there were some close calls and we didn   t get it right. We will work on it more.   After the experience in Pune and Virat Kohli   s rather impulsive review on day one to overturn a leg-before decision against him, it is fair to say that India was a tad circumspect on the field.An initial burst of excitement was often followed by a sedate response, for none of the decisions seemed like howlers.That level of caution perhaps cost the host when it chose not to review a catch off Umesh Yadav   s bowling with Shaun Marsh batting on 14. Replays suggested that it had clipped the glove but only Wriddhiman Saha, the wicketkeeper, was excited. The 33-year-old left-hander went on to score a battling 66.Getting better   We had to take that chance but we didn   t go for it,    said Pujara.    Probably that   s something that we can work on but we are getting better with DRS.   After the number of reviews was reset at the turn of 80 overs, India was yet again trigger-happy.Perhaps the fact Australia was five wickets down played a part in the desperation. In a matter of seven overs, it exhausted both the allotted reviews.On Saturday, Nathan Lyon was asked if Australia   s longer experience with DRS helped them, he said:    I suppose so. We   ve played a fair amount of cricket over the last few years with DRS but it   s up to the individual.      We   ve got a really good platform now: we go straight to Matt Wade, the bowler and Steve Smith. Those three decide, and there   s no other real input unless someone   s seen something pretty obvious. DRS is here to stay; we   ve just got to use it to our advantage.   All of this suggests that DRS isn   t an exact science. It   s a balancing act which can be better honed only with time, experience and better decision-making protocols.India will have to learn from the experiences it has had with the DRS in this series thus far.I suppose so. We   ve played a fair amount over the last few years with DRS    Nathan Lyon,on being asked if Australia   s longer experience with DRS helped itI suppose so.

Such was the wealth of talent in Delhi.Times have changed now. Delhi   s reputation stands dented, on and off the field, and this season underlined this aspect in bold terms. Delhi has no title to showcase.K.P. Bhaskar was part of the Delhi unit at a time when it enjoyed a steady stream of talented players and dominated the domestic circuit.    It was a fantastic period when we learnt from the likes of Bedi paa (Bishan Singh), Jimmy paa (Mohinder Amarnath), Maddi paa (Madan Lal). The dressing room was a great place for cricket education. Yes, much has changed, but then we are going through a transition period and the talent is just waiting to play to its potential in the near future,    said Bhaskar, ahead of his side   s final match of the season.Delhi plays Uttar Pradesh on Monday in the last fixture of the Vijay Hazare cricket tournament. The match is only of academic interest for the teams are both out of the race for qualification.Bhaskar, however, insisted there was pride at stake.   Please remember, the team was not at its full strength right through the season. This is no excuse. We had our moments and somehow did not grab the chances. The boys did their best. I am sure they would have learnt their lessons to be better prepared for the next season. I am convinced there is talent that can be honed,    said Bhaskar.Delhi, however, has suffered from lack of consistency. The seniors, Gautam Gambhir and Shikhar Dhawan, have not been at their best. For Unmukt Chand, it was a season of despair as he lost form at a critical phase of his career. A batsman bestowed with huge talent, Chand lost his place in the squad for this tournament but earned a recall to present his credentials brightly with a half century against Kerala in Delhi   s previous match.The emphasis on    horses for courses    has not worked well for Delhi as injuries to bowlers at different stages hurt the team.The state of affairs at the Ferozeshah Kotla has also influenced the overall preparation of the team this season which saw the selectors replace Gambhir with Rishabh Pant as the captain for the Vijay Hazare tournament.A win against Uttar Pradesh at the KIIT cricket ground would be a pleasant farewell to a forgettable season for Delhi.",sports,India,Cricket

Bhagya PrakashBhagya Prakash KThere was a definite edge to proceedings at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium here on Sunday. There was no shortage of verbal sparring on the field as Steve Smith and Matt Renshaw frustrated India during an intense first session of play.Both camps, though, later dismissed all the chat as good-humoured banter. Some of the action even had the players and the crowd laughing, like when Ishant Sharma mocked Smith   s fidgeting at the crease.Smith and Virat Kohli were at the heart of the action, the first words exchanged when India felt Renshaw had obstructed R. Ashwin in his follow-through.   There was a bit of talk, but I think that   s because they   re trying to unnerve each other (Smith and Kohli),    Renshaw said later.    We took it pretty well. We know that they   re trying to get under our skin because we   ve got a 1-0 lead in the series.   But it   s all good fun; good contest out there. I was just trying to enjoy it and trying to laugh at what he was saying because some of it was quite funny.   FunnyWhat, then, had Kohli told the 20-year-old?    He was just saying that I might need to run off and go to the toilet again, like in Pune,    Renshaw said.    It was quite funny.   And how had he responded?   I don   t try and say too much out there. I just try and smile because in my experience smiling seems to unnerve the bowlers a bit more than talking back.   Cheteshwar Pujara too sought to downplay the issue.   When we play the Australian team there is always some sledging involved,    he said.   So I don   t know what the exact words were but there were some moments when they were exchanging words,    added the Indian middle-order batsman.   But all in all I think it was still in the spirit of the game. There was nothing personal in it and they were just having a chat.",sports,India,Cricket
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/beat-the-opposition-at-the-long-game/article17414768.ece,"Patience personified:Matt Renshaw played with purpose to notch up a well-deserved half-century.G.P. Sampath KumarTest cricket, Matt Renshaw said after play on Sunday, was about    trying to grind it out and beating the opposition at the long game.    He   s rather good at Test cricket, then.This series, Renshaw has spent over eight hours at the crease, and only nine innings into his international career, the opener has faced in excess of a thousand balls. On the second day of the second Test, at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, he comprehensively beat India at the    long game   , his resolute, painstaking 60 (196b, 263m) helping give Australia the advantage.Renshaw began the day on 15. It was well past lunch when he completed his half-century, having faced 136 balls since the morning, resisting some serious Indian pressure.    The plan this morning was just to try and bat as long as possible and wear the Indian bowlers down,    he said.   They   ve come off a long summer and played a lot of Tests so we know that if we can get them into a high amount of overs, we   ll be in a good position. It   s been a really good couple of days of Test cricket and that   s what it   s all about, just trying to grind it out and beat the opposition at the long game.   It was really challenging to score off both the quicks and the spinners. It was a grind. But we just needed to bat the whole day and we   ve managed to do that.   The pitch was, Renshaw said, harder to bat on than the one rolled out in Pune.    In Pune we knew it was going to spin; this one, we don   t really know which one is going to spin, so that   s probably the hardest challenge,    he said.   Some are turning quite a lot and some are not turning as much and some are just going on with the angle. It was probably a bit harder against the quicks because it   s not bouncing as much, and some are going up so I think that challenge is probably the biggest.   It helped, the Queenslander said, that R. Ashwin operated predominantly from over the wicket.    It gave us a pretty clear plan what he was trying to do and how he was trying to get us out. We worked out that and just tried to combat that as well as possible,    he said.At only 20 years of age, where did he get his patience from, Renshaw was asked.    When I was younger I wasn   t the biggest bloke and so instead of retiring on some balls, I retired on some runs.   Once we got to fifty we had to retire and someone else could come in,    he explained.    I didn   t really want to let anyone else bat. So I tried to get to fifty as slow as possible.   Such efforts will not have gone down well on children   s playgrounds, but none of his current team-mates will be complaining.",sports,Tamil Nadu,Cricket
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/allow-the-kids-to-enjoy-the-game-says-kanetkar/article17414886.ece,"Back with a bang:Nikhil Kanetkar, left, beat his old rival Abhinn Shyam Gupta in the National Masters semifinal.When he appeared on the big stage some 20 years ago, Nikhil Kanetkar mesmerised badminton buffs with his stylish play. He was light on his feet, and his deceptive skills had many of his opponents scratching their heads in confusion.Even Chinese coaches were impressed with him and that too at a time when the Indian players had not yet breached the Chinese wall in badminton.Kanetkar, who played in the 2004 Olympics and rose to a career-high of 32 in the world rankings, rolled back the years when he played multiple-National champion Abhinn Shyam Gupta in a much-anticipated above-35 semifinal of the 41st Masters Nationals at the Rajiv Gandhi indoor stadium here on Sunday.It was a dejected Kanetkar who had arrived in Kochi in 1997 for his debut on the senior national circuit. He had lost the junior Nationals, where he was one of the favourites, only days before and was in no mood to play in Kerala.But after his coach Anil Modak persuaded him that he had nothing to lose by playing, Kanetkar played without any pressure in Kochi. He was so relaxed that he even took to playing basketball every morning during the tournament.That eased his mind, and as he began winning round after round, the spark was back in his game. And when he shocked Gupta, who had by then established himself on the senior circuit, in the semifinal, he regained his confidence.That was his first big break and, though he lost to P. Gopi Chand in the final in Kochi, he soon began climbing the ladder and found his way into the Indian team for the Thomas Cup qualifiers.With Indians doing very well at the Olympics and the Majors, there is now a big rush at badminton academies all over the country.   That puts pressure on players and coaches as the parents want quick results,    said the 37-year-old who runs the Kanetkar Kanetkar Academy in Pune.   The parents meeting which I have at my academy is very important; I tell them what they should expect from their kids. And what they should not do to their kids,    said Kanetkar.   The most important thing is, the child should enjoy the game      We just need to motivate the children in a positive way. When they are on court and training hard, the child does not want to go home and again have the parent talking to them for two hours about badminton,    he said.Kanetkar, who quit his job with Indian Oil a few years ago to focus on coaching, said former internationals should be looking at coaching as a full-time career.   Of course, it   s not easy to take that plunge but I think it   s possible now, especially the way badminton has picked up,    said Kanetkar.   And at the end of the day, the experience of former players could be very important for the kids.",sports,Kerala,Badminton

Thakur and justices Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud and A.M. Khanwilkar had said in their order:    the CoA shall also ensure that the directions contained in the judgement of this Court dated 18 July 2016 are fulfilled and to adopt all necessary and consequential steps for that purpose.   Getting things doneIn the last 30 odd days, the CoA     comprising Vinod Rai (ex-Comptroller and Auditor General of India), Ramachandra Guha (historian), Vikram Limaye (MD & CEO, IDFC Ltd.) and Diana Edulji (former captain of the Indian women   s team)     got a fair bit done, like conducting the IPL auctions, clearing outstanding payments to Indian and overseas parties and announcing the BCCI award winners, among other things.The CoA also studied the Deloitte report on the functioning of majority of the full member associations.In its first status report to the Supreme Court on March 4, the CoA has stated that the BCCI has not adopted the new Memorandum of Association and Rules and Regulations, and that it can be completed only after the full member associations amend their constitutions.The report, published on the BCCI website, also states that elections have not been conducted by the majority of the full members.The report has also incorporated the minutes of the Board meeting held at the Cricket Centre last year to consider the Lodha Committee recommendations clause by clause and other issues related to compliance on the part of the State associations.A point raised by a majority of the full members is related to the rights of members of the State associations.The CoA will now wait for the apex court to clear certain matters before making its next move.Welcome moveA BCCI official welcomed CoA   s decision to post the report on the website.    They should also make public the full Deloitte report.   Let everything be transparent. None of the associations know what Deloitte has said about them.      A point raised by a majority of full members of the BCCI, on a point related to the enforcement of July 2016 order, is that     rights of members of the State associations under Article 19 (1) (c ) of the constitution of India continues to remain protected.   Touching upon this argument raised by the BCCI earlier, the Supreme Court said in its judgement of July 18    what is, however important is that the right under article 19 (1) (c) does not extend to guaranteeing to the citizens the concomitant right to pursue their goals and objects uninhibited by any regulatory or other control.The legal position in this regard is settled by several decisions of this Court.   Vinod Rai informed a gathering at an event in Singapore on Saturday that the reforms would be completed in four-five months.The report has been published on the BCCI websiteVinod Rai says reforms will be completed in four-five monthsThe CoA will now wait for the apex court to clear certain matters before making its next moveThe report has been published on the BCCI websiteVinod Rai says reforms will be completed in four-five monthsThe CoA will now wait for the apex court to clear certain matters before making its next move",sports,India,Cricket

Well, the race did fall to a member of the distaff set, except that it was not the heroine of the Kingfisher Ultra Indian Derby at Mahalakshmi four weeks ago that prevailed, but her beaten rival on that occasion. It was Temerity (by Intense Focus), third in the Indian Derby, who displayed the panache required to annex the 55th running of the Indian Turf Invitation Cup at Bangalore racecourse this afternoon.Following an even break, public choice Hall Of Famer found herself in front, closely attended by market rival Tororosso. Unfortunately the grey seemed too keen and was ticking off the metres at a torrid pace.The effort told on her and distress signals were visible as they straightened for home. Meanwhile Neeraj Rawal had positioned Temerity in fifth spot and the pair continued unhurried until the race came to a boil. Pressing the accelerator, Rawal brought his mount to the front in the straight and although Supreme General almost got to her at one stage, Temerity stretched out like the good ones do and secured the prize by 2-3/4 lengths in the excellent time of 2:28.85, a new track record. The winner, owned by M/s.

Vineeth working hard together on a pitch Roca had earlier criticized.Sandesh Jhingan saw a header from a corner bounce inches wide in the 40th minute while in the second half, Udanta Singh and Jugovic went close.Roca threw in Harmanjot Khabra for Jugovic and Daniel Lalhlimpuia for Vineeth.Lalhlimpuia had more than a few efforts to double the lead, but BFC eventually settled for the one-nil win.Bengaluru will next face Chennai City FC in Chennai, on Wednesday.",sports,India,Football

I don't think so,    he replied when asked if the 48-run lead was getting a bit out of hand.    We are very much in the game and they also have to bat fourth.   First, we   ll look to get four wickets and once we get that we have to bat well and put some runs on the board.   Pujara   s confidence might be down to the fact that India   s bowlers were persistent all through and let Australia score only 197 runs on the day.   We can see the run rate and they were not able to score many runs,    he said.    In a way, it was a [small] victory for us. We bowled tight lines. Length was were very good from the fast bowlers. All in all we bowled well and took six wickets and they didn   t score many runs.   Pujara felt that if India could bowl out Australia for the addition of another 30 or 40 runs, it will have an even chance of forcing the issue.   It will be great [if we could do that],    he said.    I think there is enough help from the pitch. We have to continue to bowl the way we have and we will have some plans tomorrow for [Mitchell] Starc and the other batsman.

Excellent because the team has found ways to do well despite the absence of players like M. Vijay, Abhinav Mukund and R. Ashwin for a major part of the season. At the ongoing Vijay Hazare tournament, the team is on the verge of qualifying for the knock-outs. It needs to beat Tripura on Monday to achieve that target.The support staff     coach Hrishikesh Kanitkar, assistant coach L. Balaji and trainer Ramji Srinivasan     works tirelessly and selflessly to keep the players in their best shape. The focus is on team-work.   From the first game, I did not stress on individual performances. The message was to perform collectively because it was about the team and not an individual. I told the team on the first day that we win or lose as a team. It helped because the players learnt to accept their responsibility and came up with matured approach to situations of pressure,    Kanitkar said.Kanitkar, in the company of Balaji and Srinivasan, works on the mindset of the players, to enable them understand the situation and adapt.   We have quite a few experienced players and all have been good in dealing with the challenges. The seniors have interacted so well with the juniors. There have been phases when we have not met the standards we had set but then we have learnt from every of those phases.   Right from the first (Ranji Trophy) match against Mumbai (at Lahli) we have been consistent in our cricket. Winning or losing is part of the journey but we have maintained a level of consistency. The team is keen on making things happen,    stressed the coach.As a player, Kanitkar had picked up lessons watching some of the greats of the game perform.    There is so much to learn. I can say from experience that respect from fellow players is very important. That has been the strong point of this team. As a team, we are a group of equals,    stated Kanitkar, in his first season as the Tamil Nadu coach after a stint with Goa.Kanitkar has made the Tamil Nadu team realise the significance of staying positive.    We have missed quite a few players at various stages. (T) Natarajan and (K) Vignesh are not here but the team has delivered. (Vijay) Shankar has also missed a few games. But we have learnt to play to our potential. (Dinesh) Karthik missed a few T20 games but we did not lose those matches. The team has never been complacent.   The players have been doing their job well and the support staff has played its role to perfection. All would be on test against Tripura which has distinguished itself with three victories.

A man should see his life as a yajnya, said M.K. Srinivasan in a discourse.When he does the morning libation, he recites the Gayatri mantra.This mantra has twenty four letters and takes care of the first twenty-four years of his life. Vasus are the deities of the morning libation. In case one is unable to do the morning libation due to illness, one should pray to the vasus, requesting them to carry over the morning libation to the noon libation, without a break, so that the yajnya is not broken in the middle.The mantra recited for midday libation is in Trishtup metre, which has forty four letters. Rudras are the deities for this libation. This libation should be seen as covering the next forty-four years of one   s life. In case the midday libation cannot be performed, then one should pray to the Rudras to carry over the morning libation to noon, without a break in the yajnya.The mantra for the evening libation is in Jagati metre, which has forty-eight letters. Adityas are the deities for this libation. If this libation is not performed, then one should pray to the Adityas that one   s life should be extended to the end of one   s span of life.The third libation covers the remaining period of one   s life span up to the 116th year.Thus the Upanishad says one should see life itself as penance and recite the prescribed mantras.

Though the racism angle has been played down, one is inclined to take the assertion with a pinch of salt (   Indian store owner shot dead outside home in U.S.   , March 5). Considering the fact that there have been a spate of incidents in the recent past, the claims of the government that it has been taking steps towards their prevention rings hollow as the Trump regime seems bent upon creating an atmosphere of insecurity for all immigrants. The Indian Embassy in tandem with the Ministry of External Affairs should liaise with the authorities in the different states in the U.S. and ensure that adequate protection is given to all Indians.

Other backward villages which have been neglected by the government should come forward and emulate the example. NGOs should also support such initiatives.Veena Shenoy,Thane, MaharashtraNeduvasal stirBefore branding any project as harmful it is necessary to dispassionately make a detailed, objective and unbiased analysis of its merits and demerits (   Talks fail, Neduvasal stir to continue   , March 5).Hydrocarbon exploration is a high risk investment and risk assessment is all the more important for successful project portfolio management. Since the Petroleum Ministry has clarified that state-of-the-art technology is being used, all aspects to safeguard the environment are sure to be taken care of.The issue can be subject to public debate. There can also be consultations with experts on the subject. People of the area should be taken into confidence. Let us avoid sensationalising or politicising the issue. Had we stopped the operationalisation of the Kudankulam nuclear power plant in deference to the opposition and mass protests some time ago, we would have lost a great source of power generation which now helps the country and the State. Tamil Nadu has attained near self-sufficiency in power generation now.Raghavan Sampath,ChennaiThe extraction of oil, methane, lignite, shale gas and other natural reserves cannot be at the cost of the cultivation of paddy, banana, coconut and other crops. To say that farmers must be    patriotic enough    to make sacrifices in the larger interest of the nation is to allow and legitimise depredation to the benefit of plutocrats. The interest of farmers living with nature in the vast expanses of the Cauvery delta must come first. No task is more important than protecting our land, our air and our water from greed and gratification for ourselves and posterity.G. David MiltonMaruthancode, Kanyakumari, Tamil NaduAadhaar insistenceThe Railway Ministry   s move towards an Aadhaar-based online ticketing system is unjustified and arbitrary (   Rlys. to make Aadhaar mandatory   , March 6). It is strange that the government should resort to such draconian measures in utter defiance of the Supreme Court   s ruling that Aadhaar should not be made mandatory. Even in the case of concessions to senior citizens proceeding on a rail journey, the existing condition of producing photo identification is fair enough. An insistence of Aadhaar is nothing but a coercive method of bringing the entire population under the Aadhaar net.K.

http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/no-time-for-complacency/article17414673.ece,"N.K. SinghThe Indian economy continues to outperform the prognosis of its critics. This is clearly true of the GDP growth estimates in the third quarter; quite at variance with what the critics of the demonetisation exercise had assumed. No doubt there could be correction in the fourth quarter, primarily to factor the impact of the informal sector. It has never been easy to capture real time data on economic activity in the informal sector. It is recognised that apart from leads and lags, the conclusions are derivative using surrogates which detract both from their timeliness and accuracy. This is not a new problem and past estimates of GDP numbers have also suffered from multiple ex-post corrections as and when data becomes unavailable.Digitisation dividendHopefully, moving towards greater digitisation and reducing dependence on cash transactions will accelerate the pace of financial inclusion and formalisation of the informal economy. Notwithstanding these, the dark prognosis of a collapse of GDP growth numbers, widespread unemployment and displacement of job workers coupled with rural distress now looks clearly misaligned with actual outcomes. The GDP estimates are supported by two other crucial independent international assessments last week. The first from the Article IV Consultations 2017 of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the second from the biennial Economic Survey of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Both these have distinct commonalities. Both conclude that Indian economic growth is robust, propelled by consumption demand and accelerated structural reforms. Both favourably allude to a rule-based framework of aligning macroeconomic policies with global standards.The overall macroeconomic framework, notwithstanding challenges, remains robust and credible. Continued fiscal consolidation, a modest current account deficit, subdued inflation, enhanced public and private consumption somewhat offsetting the depressed private investment support this conclusion. These augur well for continued growth buoyancy. The downside risks of exogenous shocks from sharp increases in commodity prices, particularly oil, a sudden global slowdown impacting remittances and exports or unpredictability relating to the Chinese economy now look modest. The growth projection of 7.5% (the higher side of the 6.75-7.5% range forecasted in this year   s Economic Survey) for the next fiscal is however contingent on resolving several short-term challenges.Macro policiesFirst, the OECD   s survey raises concerns about India   s large interest payments due to the high levels of public debt as compared to other emerging economies. This is in consonance with the suggestions of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Review Committee chaired by me, which projects a declining debt-to-GDP ratio to approximately 60% by 2023. Analysts believe this may be our near optimum debt levels. While the Committee   s report is not yet in the public domain, there is broad consensus that the preferred trajectory of debt with enabling fiscal deficit targets is central to macroeconomic stability. India has come a long way in discouraging fiscal profligacy. The realisation that we are best served by improving the quality of public expenditure than enhancing budgetary outlays reflects responsible leadership. It is increasingly cognisant of the inherent vulnerabilities of a fragile economy like ours. No doubt fiscal rectitude must be combined with space to enhance public outlays, particularly in infrastructure, health and education.Second, the health of the banking and financial sector. The twin balance sheet problem of both corporates and banks, highlighted in the Economic Survey, has a relationship but would need differentiated actions. Easing one will no doubt ameliorate the other but policy frameworks are not necessarily symmetrical. The concept of a centralised Public Sector Asset Rehabilitation Agency (PARA) envisaged as a    Band Bank    spin-off model has gained some traction. It would, however, be na  ve to believe that this represents a systemic solution to the ailments of the banking sector. The classic issues of not confusing between the stock and the flow would need to be addressed. Besides, it is not easy to overlook moral hazard questions when it comes to taking an    appropriate haircut    by all stakeholders and without assigning responsibility for the ills of the past.Are we assured that they will not resurface in altered garbs? The governance architecture embedded in several actions and intended autonomy cannot be totally divorced from the ownership pattern. Creating an enabling political milieu for deeper reforms is inescapable. Expecting the ruling party alone to invest excessive political capital in this endeavour will have little traction. At the same time, a belief that the present trajectory of banking reforms is adequate to address the deeper malaise of the sector would be misplaced. The Indradhanush I has distinct positives. The Indradhanush II is in the offing, post the Asset Quality Review to be completed by March 31.Rule-based managementIn this context, creating an institutional framework or mechanism to seek broader consensus has some advantages. This also ties up with what the OECD   s Economic Survey and the IMF   s report describe as a progressive move to a more rule-based management of the economy. The constitution of the Monetary Policy Committee, GST Council, Banks Board Bureau, are robust examples. Could we, for instance, consider the constitution of a Banking Council to facilitate a dialogue with political parties and stake holders on a new banking road map? Extensive analytical work by several committees and commissions like the Narasimham Committee, P.J. Nayak Committee, Gopalakrishna Committee, to mention a few, have critically examined the past and suggested future actions. This Council could debate, discuss, and seek to fortify the ingredients of the ongoing initiatives. In this endeavour, seeking consensus on a forward banking reform path would be the principal mandate of the Banking and Finance Council. The problem is somewhat complicated, by the Reserve Bank acting as the principal banking ombudsman with inherent conflict of interest. In the long run, we need an alternative mechanism for the banking sector. This will not happen overnight; far-reaching structural changes need perseverance and tenacity. Fortunately, this government has the mindset to move away from micromanaging the economy.The GST transformationFinally, for a change, balanced regional development and combining growth with employment has received extensive attention in both these reports. No doubt, the GST (Goods and Services Tax) regime and decisive move towards formalisation of the economy using technology would reduce disparities.Local government entities need greater empowerment. These go beyond the enhanced devolution of resources based on the recommendation of the Thirteenth Finance Commission, more importantly of the Fourteenth Finance Commission. Making grants available in two parts     a basic grant and performance grant     will make a difference. Enabling local bodies to impose and realise property taxes and other levies would strengthen their financial viability. In fact, the Fifteenth Finance Commission, yet to be constituted, while reviewing the implementation of past recommendations can consider incentivising States on empowerment and delegation of powers to local bodies. Seeking to replicate best governance practices in labour and product markets among the States could also prove beneficial in mitigating inter-State growth divergence. There are other recommendations in the IMF and OECD reports relating to education, health, and tax changes, to name a few, which deserve separate treatment.It would be dangerous if the decision-making ethos is stymied by growing complacency. The future may look bright but pursuing and deepening structural reforms is the way forward. The political leadership is sagacious in recognising this. After all, as Albert Einstein once said,    We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.   N.K.

http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/indiscriminate-discrimination/article17414687.ece,"Driven out:   The first wave of Indian migrants to the U.S. became the target of resentment from white workers.      The Bellingham Herald    dated 1907 reports the persecution of Indians in Bellingham, Washington.Source: Paul EnglesberU.S. President Donald Trump, in his address to Congress, may have denounced the killing of Indian engineer Srinivas Kuchibhotla in Kansas, but it is hard to ignore that his own polarising presidential campaign has directly led to the current intolerant climate in the U.S.On the surface, this killing may seem like a case of mistaken identity. In a misguided stab at self-preservation, some NGOs have recommended to the Hindu community in the U.S. that they should appear more    assimilated    or highlight their identity. But doing so would be to ignore a crucial lesson from this tragedy: the tools of prejudice, once unleashed, can be indiscriminating in choosing their targets.Historical persecutionThe first Indian migrants to reach the U.S. understood this lesson well. Arriving in the beginning of the 20th century, they faced severe persecution and bigotry. For decades before their arrival, American society had been perfecting the mechanisms of oppression against various communities: the Japanese, Chinese, Koreans, African-Americans and Native Americans. Now these tools could be turned against the Indians.The first wave of Indian migrants to the U.S. was a few thousand in number, consisting mostly of unskilled farmers from Punjab and former soldiers of the British empire. Making their way via Canada, these migrants first arrived in Washington where they found work in the lumber industry. Just months after their arrival, they became the target of resentment from white workers who were afraid of cheap Asian labour. On September 5, 1907, a mob of several hundred white people rounded up about 700 Indian workers and forced them to leave the town of Bellingham. Two months later, 500 Indian workers were similarly driven out of the town of Everett. Indian workers in Tacoma were attacked by another mob, although in this case they managed to fight back.The total number of Indians in Washington could not have been more than 2,000, which was hardly an economic challenge to the state   s population of over one million at the time. Yet the xenophobic mob was quick to act and could do so with impunity because it was an established practice in the state for over two decades. It had begun in 1885, when 500 Chinese workers were similarly driven out of Tacoma.Marginalisation of Indians was widespread. They were not allowed into local unions or churches. In many towns, local real estate agents refused to sell them property. Collectively referred to as Hindus     although most early migrants were Sikh     they were mocked by the media. Several local politicians and officials openly endorsed violence against them to keep    the East Indian on the move   . Immigrants from other parts of Asia had been facing such persecution for many years; Indians were just added victims.By the turn of the decade, most Indians had been driven out of Washington. Along with new immigrants, they made their way to California, where the Indian population reached close to 3,000. However, here too, the forces of racism greeted them. A pre-existing    Japanese and Korean Exclusion League    was quickly renamed as the    Asiatic Exclusion League    and its members trained their guns on Indian immigrants.    Wholesale landings of large number of Hindoos    was widely decried.Racial theoriesAt first, Indians proved to be a challenge to the half-baked racist ideologies prevalent at the time. South Asians were believed to be of    Aryan descent   , the same as Europeans. But this obstacle was quickly overcome. Racist propaganda admitted that the Americans were distant cousins of northwestern Indians. However,    our forefathers pressed to the West, in the everlasting march of conquest, progress and civilisation. The forefathers of Hindus went east and became enslaved, effeminate, caste-ridden and degraded,    one exclusionist leader wrote. Partly due to such propaganda, by 1917, immigration from India and other Asian countries was practically barred.These absurd racial theories reached their crescendo over the struggle for naturalised citizenship. In 1922, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that    white persons    eligible for American citizenship had to be of the Caucasian race. The decision was aimed at excluding the Japanese. Indians, hoping to circumvent the ruling, made the case that    high-caste Hindu, of full Indian blood    were, in fact, Caucasian. In 1923, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind that intermarriages between Aryan invaders and    dark-skinned Dravidians    over the centuries had destroyed the purity of Aryan blood in India. Hence, Indians could not be considered as    free white persons    and given American citizenship. In 1926, the Indian central legislature banned Indian citizenship to American citizens in response. However, it was little more than a symbolic gesture.Over the next decade, the U.S. government used the Supreme Court ruling to strip citizenship of many Indians who had been naturalised. The ruling was reversed only in 1946, allowing a hundred Indians to immigrate to the U.S. every year. But it was not until 1965, when American immigration laws were reformed, that the second wave of Indian migration to the U.S. could begin.Tools of prejudiceThe hostility that early Indian migrants to the U.S. faced was not due to their actions or the history of their country of origin. It was a mechanism already in place, actively oppressing other communities for decades. Given the circumstances, it was almost natural that the hostility would turn on Indians when they reached American soil. It is ironic that discrimination, when choosing its victims, can be highly indiscriminate. In early 20th century U.S., the same forces of oppression that targeted Indians were also persecuting other communities. It is this history that   s in a way, tragically, illuminating today.Sandeep Bhardwaj is with the Centre for Policy Research, New Delhi",other,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-end-of-a-voyage/article17414676.ece,"Srikant KesnurIt was the summer of 1986 when the Indian Navy was abuzz with excitement, waiting for the arrival of INS Viraat, India   s second aircraft carrier, which would radically alter the Navy   s operational paradigms. It was also a time when we, as navy men, had just been commissioned. The 1980s had seen the induction of several new classes of ships. In fact, the entire inventory had undergone a sea change then with the most important of these acquisitions being the mighty Viraat. We secretly nursed the ambition of driving the jumbo-sized    Grey Ferrari    and launching her mean flying machines. A year later, I was appointed on the missile destroyer, INS Ranvir, based at Mumbai. Time flew and I soon found myself in the midst of a huge crowd that had gathered on the South breakwater in August 1987 as Viraat drew in majestically. I shared the sense of awe everyone expressed and could sense the sheer might that she exuded.The carrier environmentWatch-keeping on Ranvir was a great learning curve which was made steeper by the presence of the carrier in the fleet. As any navy man will tell you, fleet operations acquire a different and distinct hue when an aircraft carrier is around. It was our great fortune that our formative years were spent in such a tough environment. Be it anti-submarine warfare or flying ops, underway replenishment or missile defence, an aircraft carrier brings in a unique set of dynamics and makes life on the bridge and operations room that much more exciting and busy not only on the    Flattop    itself but on all the combatants in her company. In a sense, we cut our teeth in the best learning environment possible.This was also true of our time in the harbour when the carrier generated a great deal of hustle and bustle. Being in the same fleet meant that one visited Viraat often and each time I left the ship I came away with the feeling of admiration at the way things seemed to work with clockwork precision. The crew always seemed to have an air about them and were usually the winners in most of the intra-fleet competitions, be it on the sports field or in academic endeavours.My duties over the next few years continued on other ships in the Western Fleet, and in the vicinity of the    Flattop   . She continued to be the toast of the Navy and my desire to serve on her remained undiminished. Finally, in 2003, I was appointed the fleet communications officer reporting to the Western Fleet Commander. The carrier was the first choice as the flagship because of operational and administrative advantages. We spent many days on the carrier and she soon became a second home. With a better understanding of fleet operations and tactics, I was able to appreciate what working on the aircraft carrier was like. I spent many an hour trying to walk on her deck or watching her aircraft, the Sea Harriers, take off or land. I could now claim some kinship with Viraat though I was still not a fully paid up member.Reassuring presenceTime passed and I moved to other ships. And the aircraft carrier sailed on. But all good things have to come to an end. The news of her decommissioning has filled me with sorrow. She has been the centrepiece of the Indian Navy over 30 years, her life mirroring ours. Viraat and ships of that generation ushered in a huge change in our fleet operations and in the way we thought of tactics or imagined combat. For three decades, she showcased India   s blue water capability across the seas. When the security environment in the neighbourhood was fraught with uncertainty, her presence was deeply reassuring as she protected and projected India   s maritime interests in the neighbourhood and beyond.Twenty years ago, on January 31, 1997, when another iconic ship in India   s naval history, INS Vikrant, and India   s first aircraft carrier, was decommissioned, I saw many navy men of that era who had been associated with her with hardly a dry eye. The thought of it being the turn of Viraat now induces the same feeling in our generation of officers and sailors. We may not wear our hearts on our sleeves but to recollect the lyrics of the famous Manna Dey song, Viraat has been both our    Aarzoo    and    Aabrooh   . When the naval ensign is lowered for one last time on her today, March 6, 2017, she will slowly fade away and mark the end of an era. But she will live forever in our memories.Commodore Srikant Kesnur is a serving Naval Officer",other,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/serendipity-and-zemblanity/article17414682.ece,"William Boyd in his 1998 novel, Armadillo, created an antonym for serendipity. He called it zemblanity. If serendipity implies pleasant discoveries by chance, zemblanity is    the faculty of making unhappy, unlucky and expected discoveries by design.    The novel revolves around these twin poles of serendipity and zemblanity, bringing out our daily life that oscillates between utopian dreams and a dystopian reality.Last week, I was torn between serendipity and zemblanity. I was asked to review a book for Frontline magazine, Weapons of Math Destruction , by Cathy O   Neil. Dr. O   Neil started the Lede Program in Data Journalism at Columbia. Her earlier book, in collaboration with Rachel Schutt, Doing Data Science , remains one of the finest textbooks in big number-crunching. However, her latest book explains the inherent problems in big data. She establishes the ironic relationship between the high assumptions behind mathematical models and the inequality they breed. The assumptions are that mathematical models would ensure greater fairness, eliminate bias, and judge by universal rules. But in reality, the book explains how these models become toxic by reinforcing stereotypes, by being opaque and incontestable, even when they are wrong. Reading Dr. O   Neil   s book was a moment of serendipity to learn about the tyranny of numbers.India   s growth storyThe zemblanity moment happened when the Central Statistics Office (CSO) retained its January estimate for growth in gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016-17 at 7.1%. If these figures were right, it meant that independent economic forecasters had got their estimates about the potential slowdown due to demonetisation completely wrong. This newspaper   s Editorial,    Resilience reaffirmed    (March 2, 2017), reveals the dilemma in accepting these figures at face value. It read:    The Survey had also made a cautionary assertion that recorded GDP growth would    understate    the overall impact of demonetisation as    the most affected parts of the economy     informal and cash based     are either not captured in the national income accounts or, to the extent they are, their measurement is based on formal sector indicators.    When dealing with statistics, it is safer to keep all the caveats in mind.   Prime Minister Narendra Modi used these figures at an election rally at Maharajganj in Uttar Pradesh.    On the one hand are those [critics of note ban] who talk of what people at Harvard say, and on the other is a poor man   s son, who, through his hard work, is trying to improve the economy,    he said. This was indeed a powerful political rhetoric that may well resonate with the people. But does it really address the problems relating to big data collection, its analysis, and the models?Ever since the government decided to change the base year for GDP calculation from 2004-2005 to 2011-2012 under Prime Minister Modi   s regime, there are more questions than answers about almost all our economic data. We are still not sure about the quantum of notional increase as against the real increase in GDP because of this shift. Second, to have a comparative analysis, we need data that are aligned to a set of rules and categories without introducing a new variable. But this was not available even for the latest Budget figures.The Budget that was presented on February 1, 2017 removed for the first time the distinction between plan and non-plan categories. The government also merged the Railway Budget with the Union Budget. One has to first actively disaggregate the figures sector-wise and department-wise to compare the figures with earlier estimates and arrive at some meaningful comparisons. In this context, there is no conclusive method to understand the real impact of demonetisation on India   s growth story. According to Pronab Sen, former chief statistician of India, the informal sector in India accounts for about 45% of gross domestic product (GDP) and nearly 80% of employment. If this sector is not taken into account, then the metadata not only remains inadequate but also may be seen as a deliberate move to mislead.While this newspaper has done an excellent job in reporting the official figures and explanations, there is a gap in interpreting and critiquing big data. With policy decisions becoming a product of mathematical models and data, it is worth creating in-house expertise in this crucial area as the next step in public interest journalism.readerseditor@thehindu.co.in",other,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/elusive-reconciliation/article17414669.ece,"A United Nations report released last week on the progress of reconciliation efforts by the Sri Lankan government should be a wake-up call for President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Raising serious concerns about the delay in addressing allegations of war crimes and in meeting other promises Colombo made when it co-sponsored a resolution at the UN Human Rights Council in 2015, the report warns the government that the lack of accountability threatens the momentum towards lasting peace. It also alleges that cases of excessive use of force, torture and arbitrary arrests still continue in Sri Lanka, almost eight years after the country   s brutal civil war ended. Mr. Sirisena came to power on a promise that he would restore the rule of law, end the country's international isolation and take steps towards reconciliation with the Tamil ethnic minority. The political momentum was also in favour of the government as it had the support of the dominant sections of the two largest parties in the country. In 2015, when Sri Lanka agreed to a host of measures at the UNHRC, including a judicial process to look into the war crimes, hopes were high.Undeniably, the government has made some slow progress in addressing the issue of reconciliation. Compared to the previous regime of Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Sirisena administration has reached out to Tamils and initiated constitutional and legal reforms. It has also passed enabling legislation to establish an Office of Missing Persons to help find some of the 65,000 people reported missing during the war. But on key issues such as establishing a hybrid judicial mechanism with domestic and foreign judges and returning the military-occupied lands to Tamil civilians in the north and east, there has been no tangible progress. The latest UN report comes at a time when over a hundred displaced Tamil families are protesting at administrative offices in the north and east asking for their lands to be returned. For its part, the government may be wary of taking quick decisions for fear of giving some leeway to Sinhala nationalist factions at a time when Mr. Rajapaksa is trying to revive his political fortunes. But this delay is alienating the government   s allies, eroding the faith of the public, especially war victims, and giving more time to the opposition to regroup itself. And issues such as continuing use of excessive force and arbitrary arrests suggest that the government is either not serious in changing the way the police system works or is incapable of doing so. The Sirisena-Wikremesinghe government should seize the moment and start addressing the core issues, keeping reconciliation and the future of Sri Lanka in mind.",other,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/saving-the-ghats/article17414670.ece,"The hesitation shown by the Central government in deciding upon full legal protection for one of its most prized natural assets, the Western Ghats in their totality, is a major disappointment. The idea that whatever is left of these fragile mountainous forests should be protected from unsustainable exploitation in the interests of present and future generations, while presenting sustainable ways of living to the communities that inhabit these landscapes, is being lost sight of. Quite unscientifically, the issue is being framed as one of development-versus-conservation. Given the weak effort at forging a consensus, there is little purpose in the Centre returning to the drawing board with another draft notification to identify ecologically sensitive areas. What it needs is a framework under which scientific evidence and public concerns are debated democratically and the baseline for ESAs arrived at. It is accepted, for instance, that the Ghats play an irreplaceable role in mediating the monsoon over the country and the forests harbour a rich biodiversity that has not even been fully studied. New species continue to emerge each year in an area that has endemic plants and animals, although, as the scientist Norman Myers wrote nearly two decades ago, only 6.8% of primary vegetation out of the original 182,500 sq km remains in the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka taken together. The ecologically sensitive nature of the forests stretching 1,600 km along the western coast as a global biodiversity hotspot was emphasised by the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel headed by Madhav Gadgil, while for conservation purposes, the Kasturirangan Committee identified only a third of the total area. Both expert groups have encountered resistance from State governments and industries, although they mutually differ in their recommendations.The question that needs speedy resolution is how much of the Western Ghats can be demarcated as ecologically sensitive, going beyond the system of national parks and sanctuaries that already exist. As a corollary, are other areas free to be exploited for industrial activity, including mining and deforestation, with no environmental consequences? A frequently cited example of destruction is the loss of ecology in Goa due to rampant, illegal mining. More complicated is the assessment of ecosystem services delivered by the forests, lakes, rivers and their biodiversity to communities. Mr. Gadgil, for instance, has underscored the unique value of some locations, such as those with fish or medicinal plant diversity peculiar to a small area, which should not get lost in the assessment process. All this points to the need for wider and more open consultation with people at all levels, imbuing the process with scientific insights. The sooner this is done the better. Several options to spare sensitive areas will emerge, such as community-led ecological tourism and agro-ecological farming. A national consultative process is urgently called for.",other,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/stealing-the-initiative/article17414679.ece,"k. murali kumarUsually, things made of steel are expected to last a long time. But a proposed steel flyover in Bengaluru, commissioned by the Congress government in Karnataka at a cost of Rs. 1,791 crore, ended up being a political steal for the BJP. The project, to construct a 6.7 km-long six-lane flyover, was proposed in 2010, ironically when the BJP was in power, to deal with Bengaluru   s notorious traffic situation. It was mentioned in the State budget in 2014, estimated at that time to cost Rs. 1,130 crore.However, in September 2016, when the State Cabinet cleared the project, it put the cost at Rs. 1,791 crore. Resident groups called it    obnoxious    and galvanised to protest against it. They formed an extraordinary human chain along the Airport Road where the flyover was to be constructed, and discussed it on Twitter where it trended as #SteelFlyoverBeda (We don   t want a steel flyover).Congress leaders dismissed the protests and alleged that it was a motivated campaign by the BJP and a Rajya Sabha MP, Rajeev Chandrashekhar, who is seen to be close to the BJP. Apart from civil society and well-known personalities, the Namma Bengaluru Foundation, which is funded by Mr. Chandrashekar, played a key role in the protests.The government, however, was determined. Even serious questions about how the cost of the flyover was calculated, tenders allegedly without due process were awarded, and a stay order by the National Green Tribunal did not deter it.Corruption allegationsThings began changing when BJP State president B.S. Yeddyurappa claimed, about a month ago, that he had evidence to prove that large    kickbacks    from awarding contracts for the project were paid to Congress leaders. Initially this was dismissed as a political allegation but later, when Mr. Yeddyurappa said that he would make public the contents of a diary belonging to Congress MLC K. Govindaraj, the issue began to simmer. The Congress, in turn, released a video of a purported conversation between Union Minister Ananth Kumar and Mr. Yeddyurappa, claiming that they were conspiring against the State government.The contents of the diary were then    leaked    to the media. They suggested that bribes amounting to Rs. 65 crore were paid to the top leadership, sending the Congress into damage-control mode. The BJP demanded a CBI probe.The State government, which had until then held a tough stand, was forced to retreat in order to avoid further snowballing of the controversy. This meant that the BJP won politically. Given that there is only a year left for the State Assembly elections, the State government buckled under pressure.Nothing has changed in Bengaluru   s traffic situation though. After he announced that the project was scrapped, Minister for Bengaluru Development and Town Planning K. J. George was asked if there was an alternative project to ease the traffic.

A stable operationalisation of regular legislative elections with a great degree of contestation has been a norm too, irrespective of whether or not the States are relatively poor in economic indices. This has belied most Western political scientists    research studies which aver that democracy tends to consolidate further only in countries that have strong economic indices.

I   m leaning towards voting for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). But can the BJP win from here? I like the Samajwadi Party (SP) too,    says the middle-aged man as he makes our tea. His wife interjects,    The SP will win.    The middle-aged man continues,    (BJP leader) Yogi Adityanath has done so much for the area.    His wife looks up from making fresh pakoras, pauses, and quips sarcastically,    Oh yeah, he   s a good man.    The woman seems to have made up her mind, but her husband seems genuinely torn as to whether he will cast his vote for the BJP or the SP, adding,    it   s always good to cast the deciding vote for the winner.   As the election in U.P. comes to a close, it is becoming increasingly clear that it will turn on how individuals like the man in the tea shop will cast their votes. The key to comprehending the ways in which voters make electoral choices is to analyse how voters order the possible parties in front of them, and how voters choose to behave given this ordering-over of parties. An ordering-over of possible parties describes a voter   s most preferred party, second-most preferred party, and so on, unadulterated by external considerations such as the competitiveness of the candidate.Consider, for instance, a particular voter from the Bania community for whom the BJP is the most preferred party, the SP is the second-most preferred party, and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) is the third-most preferred party. We may ask two important questions about this    preference ordering    of possible parties. First, how certain is the voter about this preference ordering; that is, is it plausible for the voter to change the ordering of parties by the day of the vote? Second, is the voter strategic; that is, would the voter still cast a vote for the BJP even if the voter believed the BJP had little chance to win the seat in the constituency?The floating voteOne may distinguish between two types of voters: core voters and floating voters. A core voter is one for whom the preference-ordering of possible parties will not change before the vote, and who will always vote for her top choice. Empirically, in a three-cornered fight like in the U.P. election, these are voters who display a strong emotional connection to one party as well as a strong dislike for another party. This includes, for instance, a Muslim individual who strongly supports the SP and dislikes the BJP, or a Hindu nationalist with a strong BJP preference who is particularly turned off by the SP   s association with Muslims.A floating voter is still uncertain over the preference-ordering of possible parties and is often persuaded by a larger narrative that appeals more broadly. But it seems that all of the major parties are struggling to build such a narrative. As we discussed in our previous article (   Bywords in Bundelkhand   , Feb.28), Akhilesh Yadav   s attempt to rebrand the SP on the basis of broad-based development has been largely undercut by frustrations with local domination by Yadav leaders, the backbone of the SP organisation. This leaves an opportunity for the BJP to build a larger narrative as the party that does not cater to any specific caste (unlike the SP and the BSP).Religious polarisationBut the BJP may have missed a golden opportunity. Since a commanding performance in the 2014 national election, the BJP has been haemorrhaging supporters in U.P. Rather than building its campaign around Prime Minster Narendra Modi   s appeal as an efficient leader and around larger goals of economic development, which has the power to unite broad swathes of the population, the BJP has once again opted for religious polarisation, as it did during the Bihar Assembly elections in 2015. In a recent speech in Fatehpur, accusing the SP of bias towards the Muslim community, Mr. Modi proclaimed,    If a village makes a kabristan (Muslim burial ground), then a shamshaan (Hindu cremation ground) must be made as well.   Despite being the home for rabble-rouser and BJP leader Yogi Adityanath, we found little evidence of serious religious polarisation, especially in comparison to western U.P., in the eastern part of the State     commonly referred to as Purvanchal     which brings up the final two phases of the election. The inability to develop any other narrative in this region may prove to be problematic for the BJP.There is a large Bhojpuri-speaking population in these parts, and the social structure in this region of U.P. is similar to western Bihar and quite different from the rest of U.P. Many voters here seem uncertain about whom to support and who will become the largest party in U.P. Just outside Banares Hindu University, we meet an elderly Brahmin shopkeeper branded with a tilak on his forehead, demonstrably a core BJP supporter. He recounts meeting an anxious BJP candidate a few days earlier, noting,    If this candidate is so unsure of himself, how many of our candidates will Mr. Modi realistically be able to help?    Truth be told, the BJP faithful from the region are far more nervous about the BJP   s prospects than the Delhi-based media.The strategic voteThe standard approach for a party to win in an election involves cultivating enough support among floating voters who, in addition to core supporters, generate a large enough coalition of voters to win the election. In an election where parties have been unable to generate a convincing larger narrative to construct a strong coalition of voters, strategic voters have become more important. Unlike a sincere voter, who always votes her most preferred party, a strategic voter is a voter who is averse to    wasting    a vote on a party that has little chance of winning in the constituency, and, thus, votes for the preferred party among the top two parties in the constituency. The explicit aim of strategic voting is to impact electoral outcomes.In Etawah and Mainpuri, our driver, from the Chaudhuri sub-caste, openly declared his intent to vote for the BJP, as he was a great admirer of Mr. Modi and strongly disliked the SP. As he travels with us, he becomes convinced that the BJP has little chance of winning in his home constituency.    I want to vote for the BJP, but I don   t want to waste my vote. Should I vote for the BSP?    After a discussion with other voters about likely outcomes in the constituency, he determines that it is in his best interests to strategically cast his vote for the BSP. Similarly, as we described in detail in a previous piece, most of the Muslim voters we meet in Meerut district are worried about the religious violence that has characterised the region and are willing to support either the SP or the BSP, whichever had a better chance of defeating the BJP. Strategic voting involves a calculation that is typically performed at the last minute, and is thus difficult to ascertain for most political analysts. And, contrary to popular belief, strategic voting is not limited to a particular caste or religion; most voters exhibit some modicum of strategy.Herein lies an electoral benefit for the BSP. Unlike the BJP, which is unlikely to receive votes from Muslims, and the SP, which is unlikely to receive support from a subset of Hindu voters due to its association with the Muslim and Yadav communities, the BSP has the capacity to draw a strategic vote from across the landscape of castes and religions. In particular, the BSP can draw Muslims voters strategically where the BJP is competitive and can draw anti-Yadav and (to some extent) anti-Muslim voters where the SP is competitive. When this is added to a stable group of supporters among the Jatav community (about 11% of the State   s population) and significant vote share among the rest of the Dalit community (another 10% of the State), the strategic vote may be enough to construct a large vote share for the BSP. But in order for the strategic vote to have this sort of impact for the BSP, it must be seen as competitive (i.e., in the top two parties) in a large number of constituencies.The BSP has received little press coverage. But come election day, the BSP   s    silent voters    may help the party pull a surprise. After all, no one ever hears the voices of strategic voters.Neelanjan Sircar, Bhanu Joshi and Ashish Ranjan are affiliated with the Centre for Policy Research in Delhi",other,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/cracking-the-gdp-mystery/article17420118.ece,"Aarati KrishnanDid demonetisation deal a knock-out punch to the Indian economy? Or was it just a mild tap from which it is already recovering?This debate should have been settled with the latest second advance estimates from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) which peg FY17 GDP growth at 7.1%. But commentators who believe that the economy has suffered a debilitating blow from the note ban are not willing to rest their case here. They have flagged a long list of issues with these GDP numbers, apart from hinting that the numbers are fudged.However, this is taking the criticism a little too far. A closer analysis of the CSO   s estimates suggests that, contrary to perception, they do factor in the impact of the note ban. And while India   s GDP estimation method could certainly do with improvements, the CSO has been both transparent and consistent with its methods, allowing little room for suspicions of window-dressing.Why so high?First, the sceptics ask, how did the GDP growth for FY17 turn out to be so high? The 7.1% number is unchanged from the CSO   s initial estimates and is also well above the 6.5%-6.8% growth estimated by most private forecasters. Is the CSO implying that vacuuming up 86% of cash in circulation had no impact on the economy?Well, that is a wrong reading of the numbers. To gauge the actual level of economic activity, Gross Value Added (GVA) is the more pertinent number than GDP. The GVA measures the value of output created by different segments of the economy. Indirect taxes (minus subsidies) are added to it, to arrive at the GDP.The GVA for FY17, as per CSO data, does show a dent from demonetisation. At 6.7%, it has registered a sharp decline of 110 basis points from 7.8% (revised estimate) for FY16.While GVA growth is pretty close to private forecasts, what lifted the GDP is the strong 12.3% surge in indirect taxes that the CSO estimates for this fiscal. This is a plausible number, given that the Centre   s indirect tax collections already surged by 25% in April-December 2016, powered by higher excise duty on fuel and service tax.There is no obfuscation here, because assessing the GVA and adding back net taxes is the global prescription for GDP estimation by the output method.Too mild?So the CSO does admit that economic activity has been impacted by the note ban. But isn   t it estimating too mild an impact, with the Q3 GVA growth at 6.6%, against 7% last year?Commentators cite some key indicators to    prove    that economic activity shrank in the note ban months. For instance, two-wheeler sales collapsed by 22% year-on-year in December, banks reported anaemic loan growth at 5%, cement despatches fell by 9% and realtors saw a 40% dip in home sales.But given that the economy is made up of literally hundreds of products and sectors, it is well within the realm of possibility that the economy did well even while these indicators slowed. For instance, for the same December month, steel output grew by 15%, power generation surged by 6% and refinery output expanded 6.4%. If bank credit slumped, companies doubled their borrowings from the bond market.Also, CSO estimates do show that some sectors of the economy took it on the chin in the demonetisation quarter. Manufacturing saw its GVA growth slide from 12.8% in Q3 2015 to 8.3% in Q3 2016. Finance, real estate and services saw growth collapse from 10.4% to 3.1%. Construction weakened from 3.2% to 2.7%.But making up for these was the 6% rebound in agriculture (2.2% shrinkage last year), 6.8% increase in electricity, gas and water supply and a bumper 11.9% hike in    public administration, defence and other services    which lifted the GVA.Agricultural output bounced back due to a good monsoon after consecutive drought years. Electricity generation was up on better coal availability.    Public administration    reflects higher government payouts on salaries and pensions after the Seventh Pay Commission.December quarter results from listed companies also provide independent confirmation that the big picture wasn   t much dented by the note ban. A Business Line analysis of over 1,700 listed companies showed that they just reported their best quarterly performance in three years, with sales growing over 9% and profits expanding 20%.Commentary from listed firms suggests that urban discretionary purchases bounced back quickly as consumers switched to digital payments. Commodity industries, helped by global price rebound, did very well this quarter. In some sectors, business shifted from the unorganised to organised players due to digital payments.Analysts also suspect that, in some cases, companies mopped up demonetised notes from their distribution channels and pumped them with inventory instead. (This would show up as    sales    in the company   s books and as    output    in GDP estimates).As the cash situation normalises, these one-offs should get ironed out, moderating GVA growth for the March quarter. But this doesn   t imply that the Q3 GDP numbers are suspect.Informal left out?A third criticism of the CSO estimate is that it fails to capture the performance of the informal economy, which clearly bore the brunt of the note ban.This criticism is partly valid.Over 40-45% of the Indian economy is informal and hardly any data points relating to it are available at a quarterly frequency. Therefore, what the CSO does to arrive at its quick estimates of the GDP is to take the available data from the organised sector and extrapolate it to infer informal activity. Thus, the GVA for agriculture is guesstimated based on kharif and rabi crop prospects. The GVA for services is inferred from sales tax collections, deposits and credit, telephone connections and so on. Manufacturing GVA uses the index of industrial production and listed company filings.Owing to such guesswork, it is quite likely that the quarterly GVA estimate, which mainly uses data from the formal sector, painted a rosier picture of growth than the ground reality. But then, if the CSO     with its access to multiple data sources     has no way to estimate the quarterly performance of the informal sector, neither does anyone else.As long as the CSO consistently follows the same method for measuring the informal sector and publicly discloses it, this is the only estimate we have to gauge economic activity. Both the methodology for estimating informal sector performance and GDP revisions are well-documented and disclosed on the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation website.More accurate estimates of what really transpired in the Indian economy post-demonetisation will be available when the CSO publishes its first revised GDP estimates, with more ground-level data, in January 2018.Until then, critics must follow Keynes   s tenet     when facts change, it is best to change your mind.aarati.k@thehindu.co.in",other,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/all-those-who-are-out-of-the-tax-net/article17420120.ece,"Praveen ChakravartyOf nearly 127 crore Indians, only 2.6 crore pay income tax. The fact that less than 3% of Indians pay income tax is automatically construed to imply that a large majority avoid paying income tax. The Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley, made a sweeping statement in his Budget speech this year claiming that India is    a tax non-compliant society and too many people evade taxes   . Not only is the perception entrenched that too few pay income taxes but also that most Indians under-report their incomes.What data sayPrime Minister Narendra Modi exclaimed in his New Year   s eve speech that    only 24 lakh Indians reported an income greater than 10 lakh rupees. Who can digest this?    This perception that India is a land of tax avoiders and black money hoarders was first mooted by former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram who, in his 2013-14 Budget speech, emphatically asserted that    only 42,800 persons admitted to an income of more than Rs.1 crore per year   . The insinuation was that there is massive under-reporting of income. Most readers will perhaps endorse this growing chorus that India has too few honest taxpayers. Except that data belies this claim. That a large majority of Indians are tax dodgers may well be an urban legend.India   s per capita GDP is roughly Rs. 1 lakh, i.e. the average Indian earns a lakh of rupees every year. Given India   s large income inequality, it can also be inferred that when the average income is Rs. 1 lakh, a greater majority of Indians earn less than Rs. 1 lakh while a small number at the top earn large amounts. However, the income tax exemption threshold in India is Rs. 2.5 lakh, i.e. anyone earning below Rs. 2.5 lakh need not pay income tax. This implies that only those who earn more than 2.5 times the average income of Rs. 1 lakh will fall under the tax bracket. When a majority of Indians earn less than Rs. 1 lakh, an income tax exemption threshold of Rs. 2.5 lakh is sure to leave a vast majority out of the tax bracket. We also know from recent research by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) and Peoples Research on India   s Consumer Economy (PRICE) that the average income of the richest 20% of Indians is Rs. 95,000. This means that even a large majority of the richest 20% of Indians do not qualify to pay income taxes. In this context, it is not entirely surprising that only 3% of Indians pay tax. This is not a function of a large number of Indians avoiding tax, as portrayed, but merely a reflection of the fact that India is a terribly poor country with an extremely high income tax exemption threshold.Global comparisonsIndia is the only large economy with an income tax exemption threshold that is 2.5 times the average national per capita income. In most countries, including in emerging economies such as China, Brazil and Argentina, anyone earning more than half the average national income falls under the income tax bracket. India has increased the income tax exemption threshold on seven occasions, from Rs. 40,000 to Rs. 2.5 lakh in the last two decades. Contrast this with China, where the exemption threshold has just doubled from 10,000 yuan to roughly 20,000 yuan in the same period even though average incomes grew much faster in China than in India. If India lowers its income tax exemption to, say, Rs. 1 lakh from the current Rs. 2.5 lakh to be more in line with the rest of the world, nearly 1.5 crore more Indians will fall under the tax bracket. To be clear, such a move will not fetch any meaningful extra tax revenues for the government but will merely bring more people into the tax bracket. It is thus misleading and specious to conclude that India   s small number of taxpayers is entirely a result of some genetic and cultural trait of dishonesty of Indian society at large.Further, the Prime Minister   s claim or Mr. Chidambaram   s assertion is also not peculiar. Rs. 10 lakh equals 10 times India   s per capita GDP. Even in the much richer United States, only 12.5 lakh people out of nearly 20 crore adults reported an income greater than 10 times the per capita GDP of the U.S. In the United Kingdom, only 2 lakh people out of an adult population of 4 crore reported an income of greater than 10 times the average annual income. Similarly, an annual income of Rs. 1 crore in India is equal to 100 times the average annual income. What proportion of people in other countries earn more than 100 times the average annual income? Just 43,000 people in the U.S., 5,000 in the U.K. and a few hundred in Canada. The number of people earning 100 times the average national income in most nations is extremely small. Against this backdrop, out of 68 crore adults in India, 24 lakh people earning more than Rs. 10 lakh per year or 42,800 earning more than Rs. 1 crore is not as abnormal as the Prime Minister or Mr. Chidambaram suggest. This is not to imply that there is no tax evasion in India but to say that the number of Indians paying income tax or earning high incomes is not nearly as outlandishly small as claimed.Political rhetoricMost urban Indians are unable to fathom the scale and size of India   s poverty. Their immediate, lived experiences lure them into this belief that a significant majority of Indians earn more than Rs. 20,000 a month to qualify to pay income taxes. Casting aspersions on all of Indian society solely on the basis of the small number of taxpayers is plain egregious. The political compulsions of such class rhetoric are obvious as it serves as a good alibi for seemingly    tough    actions such as demonetisation. But the Finance Minister   s grand proclamation that India is a tax non-compliant society can be true only if India is much richer than her GDP numbers reveal and is merely hiding behind a veil of feigned poverty.Praveen Chakravarty is Senior Fellow at the IDFC Institute and founding trustee of IndiaSpend.

http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-tawang-test/article17420115.ece,"China   s statement that it is    gravely concerned    over the government   s decision to allow the Dalai Lama to visit Arunachal Pradesh   s Tawang monastery in early April, and that it would    seriously damage    bilateral ties, is unwarranted. It is also an unacceptable escalation of rhetoric over an issue that India and China have engaged with each other on, including during the visit by Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar to Beijing. The controversy over the Tawang area goes back to the Shimla meet of 1914, when the Chinese representatives just initialled, and didn   t sign, a trilateral agreement with British India and Tibet. Later, in 1959, when the current Dalai Lama fled Tibet, he came into India through Tawang. He has not visited Arunachal Pradesh since 2009, when he retraced his 1959 journey. On that occasion too, his itinerary had evoked threats from Beijing, but eventually bilateral concerns outweighed them. The Chinese government would do well to not allow tensions with India over the issue of Arunachal Pradesh to spill into other spheres of engagement, and perhaps to also recall its own talks with representatives of the Dalai Lama that broke down after nine rounds in 2010 when it seeks to castigate him and New Delhi for their engagement. Beijing   s objections over access for the Dalai Lama as a spiritual leader to a religious shrine obviously cannot be allowed to intimidate India into restricting his free movement.At the same time, New Delhi must calibrate its moves to avoid misperceptions that it is indulging in political power-play. Recent developments, such as visits to Tawang by American diplomats including the U.S. Ambassador, and an official dinner at the U.S. Embassy attended by a Minister and leader of the    Tibetan government in exile    based in Dharamshala, could be interpreted as messages aimed at China, even if they did not signify any policy change. Beijing has been touchy about visiting delegations from Taiwan and the grant of visas to those it perceives as dissident activists. Pinpricks cannot substitute for policy and New Delhi should keep its focus on the major issues between the two countries. The bid for Nuclear Suppliers Group membership and having Masood Azhar placed on the UN terrorists    list have occupied much of the bilateral canvas, while the larger issue of the boundary resolution hasn   t been addressed adequately. Statements last week from former Chinese special envoy Dai Bingguo, who suggested that flexibility from India over the    eastern boundary    in Arunachal Pradesh could yield flexibility from China over    other areas   , that is, the western boundary in J&K, are significant. If the statements are an indication that the 20th round of talks between the special representatives expected this year will see an opening for progress, then that is a more worthwhile goal for New Delhi and Beijing to be preoccupied with.",other,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/last-mile-concerns/article17420114.ece,"More than six months after the Constitution was amended to enable the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the Centre and States have managed to find considerable common ground on the long-debated indirect tax system, overcoming seemingly irreconcilable differences that cropped up along the way. On Saturday, the GST Council approved final drafts of the Central and Integrated GST Bills, which should be placed in the public domain as soon as possible. With the law to compensate States already cleared, the only pending legislative negotiation left for the Council, which is expected to meet again on March 16, involves the State and Union Territories    GST bills. As these bills secure assent from State Assemblies and Parliament, and swiftly, the operational rules for the GST must be readied. Industry would need at least three months after that to prepare for the transition from the present system of myriad State, Central and local levies on goods and services. Moreover, switching to a new indirect tax system in the middle of a financial year will bring its own subset of accounting complications. The Central government should resist a pushback on the roll-out date, and expedite efforts to ensure everyone is ready to get on board the new system with early clarity on what rates would apply to different goods and services.Clearer communication of intent is equally essential. In industry circles, the introduction of a peak 40% tax rate in the GST Bills has set the cat among the pigeons. What started out as a single tax, single market dream for industry has now degenerated into five tax rates, a cess on top, with additional uncertainty about tax rates. Just as effective excise and customs duties are lower than legally specified rates, working in a peak rate for the GST could well be justified. In the current rate structure, a cess has been proposed on luxury and sin goods over and above the highest GST rate of 28%. The cess would finance compensation payouts to States for the first five years. After that, it could be replaced with a higher GST rate to retain the same tax treatment on sin goods, without fresh parliamentary approval. But this intent should be stated explicitly and rates must not be tinkered with in the GST   s first five years at least. It is still not too late to settle another major worry for industry that strikes at the very heart of enterprise. The GST   s anti-profiteering penal provisions are far too vague and draconian, and could discourage companies from making efficiency improvements in supply chains if they are required to pass on the entire benefit to consumers. Lastly, the Chief Economic Adviser has made an impassioned plea to bring real estate under the GST net, linking it to the war against black money. A road map for eventually bringing such excluded sectors into the GST net could hasten the process.",other,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/cost-of-internet-shutdowns/article17420125.ece,"Digital India is now a reality. Demonetisation has reminded us of the state   s power over essential facilities in the economy and society, while the push towards a cashless India demonstrates the necessity of the mobile Internet for the economy. Family life and human relations in business processes, both within and between firms, are now dependent on the availability of digital communications, which is why the increasing spread of government-imposed Internet shutdowns throughout the country is a matter of concern. The restrictions can cancel peoples    civil rights, imperil livelihoods, and cost businesses their ability to function.In Digital India, every policy decision about the Internet affects the rights of citizens. In a cashless India     where Aadhaar numbers identify and control all buying and spending     every Indian   s privacy and freedom to participate in the market depends on Internet policies as well as the decisions of the Supreme Court concerning constitutional rights in the face of such policies. Before we can teach ourselves what is at stake, the technical and social    facts on the ground   , now being created at top speed, will have determined the nature of our political, social and economic life for generations to come.SFLC.in has released a real-time map of ongoing Internet shutdowns in India, along with resources for people to report shutdowns affecting them and information on the legalities and economic effects of these shutdowns. We can say, using data collected by SFLC.in and parties around the world, that just between 2014 and the end of 2015, Internet shutdowns cost Indian businesses almost $1 billion.Insufficient justificationsThe legal justifications offered for shutdowns, including the prevention of unlawful assembly, are far too narrow to sustain any measure with this breadth of undesired social consequence. Exigent circumstances may make it    reasonable    in our constitutional order to prohibit certain forms of speech. But a routine assertion of urgency is not sufficient justification for limiting all communications across the economic, educational and private lives of tens of millions of citizens. Another justification is that this is done to prevent the circulation of rumours. But rumours have been propagated by word of mouth since long before the printing of newspapers, let alone the adoption of the Internet.The rights of technology users, and how to protect them, are the most important issues for the next five years in India. Living in Digital India can be either a blessing or a curse depending on how we carry our democratic values into this new age. Shutdowns, which are a negative expression of the idea of digital sovereignty, are not just for undemocratic societies any more. How we cope with this issue has much to say about whether Digital India can be, and will be, a positive example to the world.Mishi Choudhary is executive director of Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC), a donor-supported legal services organisation.

http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/reforming-funding-of-polls-and-parties/article17420122.ece,"Election finance reform has once again bobbed up to the surface of public consciousness with debates on black money and the Budget proposal to cap anonymous cash donations to political parties.In their 2012 Election Law Journal paper,    Reforming India   s party financing and election expenditure laws   , M.V. Rajeev Gowda and E. Sridharan present a review of party and election financing in India and suggestions for reform. The results are based on anecdotal rather than empirical evidence and are, therefore,    tentative   .Mr. Gowda and Mr. Sridharan argue that corruption in India has thrived despite some legal and civic will to fight it. They argue that the post-Independence Licence Raj combined with a ban on corporate donations     instituted to prevent corporations from exerting a disproportionate influence on the elections     meant that there were those seeking regulatory favours from the government and a paucity of electoral funds. A good match, to say the least.By the time corporate donations were legalised in 1985, it was too late. The system had grown used to black money and there were neither tax incentives nor privacy laws to aid corporate donations. While there was some improvement in transparency in the first decade of this century, the system continued to incentivise evasiveness and false declarations. For instance, a 2003 law that capped expenditure by candidates but allowed parties and independent supporters to spend on their behalf meant that candidates were under-reporting expenditure. The Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party, the authors say, were spending four to six times the ceiling.The implications of the current regulatory environment include a dependence on black money due to a lack of public funding, low financial accountability caused by a lack of transparency and democracy within parties, and the transaction costs of numerous small donations relative to a few large ones.The authors argue that confidentiality of contributions, rather than tax deductions, will help corporations make donations without fear of political reprisal. Raising the ceiling of corporate donations too would help transparent funding. However, to altogether shift away from donations by large corporations or a wealthy few, the authors suggest nudging the system towards many smaller contributions as has been done successfully in a number of countries, such as Canada, France, Germany and the Netherlands. Indirect subsidies and individual offsetting tax credits for political contributions have helped effect this shift. Additionally, parties could receive monies from a public fund in proportion to how much grassroots funding they receive. These policies come with their own risks but are possible steps in the right direction.",other,,

Much rides on the strategy, which, if successful, could be a model for the Lok Sabha elections in 2019.The strategy can be summed up from the images in the party   s posters across the State     Prime Minister Narendra Modi with party president Amit Shah, State unit president Keshav Prasad Maurya and Union Ministers Rajnath Singh, Uma Bharti and Kalraj Mishra.While Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah effectively run party affairs, it is the projection of the others that is revealing. Mr. Maurya and Ms. Bharti are from the Other Backward Classes, though not the Yadav community, which is often seen as cornering much of the entitlements that accrue to the section.   The BJP has given over 150 seats to non-Yadav OBCs out of the 383 seats its fighting. Its ally Apna Dal too represents the non-Yadav OBC community of Kurmis and has been given 11 seats. Another ally, the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, is contesting nine seats. The party claims to command the support of the Rajbhar community, an OBC group that has been demanding inclusion in the Scheduled Caste category. They make up nearly 18% of the population in eastern Uttar Pradesh,    a senior leader said.Weaning awayA large part of the BJP   s strategy, therefore, appears to be to wean away the non-Yadav OBC groups from parties such as the Samajwadi Party (SP) that claim to represent them.   The appointment of Mr. Maurya as State unit chief is a clear signal that it is the BJP that is ready to truly empower these communities rather than the SP that only allows them to trail in the wake of a dominant Yadav group,    the leader said. This group has a presence of nearly 13-14% floating vote across the State.    Without them, the SP will only have the Yadav vote bank, with Mayawati   s Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) too poaching the Muslim vote,    he said.Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Small and Medium Enterprises Minister Kalraj Mishra represent the traditional upper caste vote bank of the BJP, namely, the Thakurs and Brahmins. The party has given 65 seats to Thakurs and 64 to Brahmins.   We are, of course, depending a lot on the personal charisma of Prime Minister Modi, but this is the nuts and bolts of our social architecture. If we win on March 11, it will be a historic transformation of the BJP from being a Bania-Brahmin party to one that will have made a significant dent into the    givens    of Lohiaite politics espoused by the socialists in the one State that hugely matters,    he said. For 2019 too then, this would be the social coalition that the BJP would espouse. Much will be decided on March 11.",national,India,Politics

Mr. Modi held close to two-dozen rallies across the State.For the Prime Minister, the election to the 403-seat State Assembly is especially important, as the result would reflect his popularity, especially after the high-risk move of demonetisation.A victory will help him consolidate the country   s most populous State ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha polls while a loss or anything less than an outright majority will be a direct reflection on the PM and his poll manager, Amit Shah, who has assiduously worked to bring the numerically significant non-Yadav backwards and non-Jatav Dalits under the BJP fold.Out on his ownIncumbent Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav also had a busy last day of campaigning     addressing seven back-to-back rallies in Jaunpur, which abuts Varanasi.

Starzl.APDr. Thomas Starzl, who pioneered liver transplant surgery in the 1960s and was a leading researcher into anti-rejection drugs, has died. He was 90.The University of Pittsburgh, speaking on behalf of Dr. Starzl   s family, said the renowned doctor died on Saturday at his home in Pittsburgh.Dr. Starzl performed the world   s first liver transplant in 1963 and the world   s first successful liver transplant in 1967, and pioneered kidney transplantation from cadavers. He later perfected the process by using identical twins and, eventually, other blood relatives as donors.Since Dr. Starzl   s first successful liver transplant, thousands of lives have been saved by similar operations.    We regard him as the father of transplantation,    said Dr. Abhinav Humar, clinical director of the Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation Institute.    His legacy in transplantation is hard to put into words it   s really immense.   Dr. Starzl joined the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine (UPMC) in 1981 as professor of surgery, where his studies on the anti-rejection drug cyclosporin transformed transplantation from an experimental procedure into one that gave patients a hope they could survive an otherwise fatal organ failure.It was his development of cyclosporin in combination with steroids that offered a solution to organ rejection.Until 1991, Dr. Starzl served as chief of transplant services at UPMC, then was named director of the University of Pittsburgh Transplantation Institute, where he continued research on a process he called chimerism, based on a 1992 paper he wrote on the theory that new organs and old bodies    learn    to co-exist without immunosupression drugs.The institute was renamed in his honour in 1996, and he continued as its director. In his 1992 autobiography, The Puzzle People     Memoirs of a Transplant Surgeon , Dr. Starzl said he actually hated performing surgery and was sickened with fear each time he prepared for an operation.

We   ve sent out loads of emails, we   ve analysed the market, we   ve pooled ideas, and we   ve just got one more meeting ahead of the launch of Operation Women   s Day on Monday,    confided Sergei Krakhmalyev, who works at Rosbank, a major Russian bank.    This year we   ve decided not to spend money on gifts that are useless, shall we say, but to organise a buffet,    he said.Mr. Krakhmalyev, who is in his 40s, works in a team of eight men and 35 women. He calculates that this year   s celebration will cost about 25,000 rubles (Rs. 28,600).    It   s expensive,    he says,    but it   s a Soviet tradition that I think it   s important to keep up.   A public holiday in the Soviet Union since 1965, March 8 is an opportunity for Russian men to    remember the importance of women    in society, he says. International Women   s Day is also a public holiday, so office celebrations are held the day before.Low-key this yearThis year   s events are expected to be relatively low-key in comparison to the oil-boom years, when many companies spared no expense.   The company used to allocate a big budget for this holiday and took as many as 500 women out to a restaurant,    recalled Irina, who works in human resources at a major Russian company.   That was before the 2008 economic crisis,    said Ms. Irina, 40, who asked not to disclose her surname.    Now the men have a whip-round to buy us flowers and chocolates.    Nevertheless the holiday    cheers up the atmosphere in the team,    she said.In Russia, it is also widely seen as a counterpart to the Day of the Defender of the Fatherland, on February 23, which is nominally for those who served in the army but is considered the male equivalent.Vitaly Konyayev, a project manager in the southern Russian city of Saratov, find it hard to get into the holiday spirit of Women   s Day.

The BJP leader said he never complained against    political criticism   , but    it was for the first time when personal imputations questioning my integrity were made   .Mr. Jaitley was cross-examined for over three hours by Mr. Jethmalani, appearing for Mr. Kejriwal, who asked when he felt an irreversible and unquantifiable damage had been caused to his reputation and if the suit had been led by personal feeling about    your own greatness   .On whether it was his    inner logic    on loss of reputation, the BJP leader said,    A person   s reputation operates in the public space and so does the loss of reputation. In addition, it causes pain and mental distress to the person defamed, which it did in my case.   Denies meeting ChetanIn his cross-examination before Joint Registrar Amit Kumar, Mr. Jaitley also denied having ever met IAS officer Chetan Sanghi, who once headed the DDCA probe panel and made him go back on his report indicting him and others in lieu of a central deputation.When Mr. Jethmalani suggested that Mr. Jaitley and his government had influenced Chetan Sanghi, the BJP leader said it was wrong to suggest the same and also it was wrong to say that he or his government was not happy with the report made by the officer.Mr. Jaitley had filed a defamation suit against Mr. Kejriwal for accusing him of a role in financial mismanagement at the DDCA, which he headed for 13 years till 2013.To a question, Mr. Jaitley said he had heard of media reports about a CBI raid on the office of a bureaucrat (Rajendra Kumar, Principal Secretary to the CM) but added,    It appears that the defendants [Kejriwal and others] made the statement that the BJP was behind this raid as their effort was to deflect the attention from the raid.   The cross-examination was briefly interrupted with the lawyers for Mr. Kejriwal and the Delhi government objecting to counsel for Mr. Jaitley leading him.Most of the 50-odd questions put to Mr. Jaitley on Monday revolved around what made him feel that the statement made by the Chief Minister had caused irretrievable damage to his reputation and did he try to contradict the allegations in the public space but failed.Some of the questions that Mr. Jethmalani posed to the BJP leader were:Since how long in the politics of this country you have known defendant no. 1 (Kejriwal)I have known about Defendant no. 1 during the last one decade on account of his political and public activities.At no time, def no. 1 has made any statement against you prior to the one mentioned in the plaint. What do you have to say?He could have made political statements critical of me in the past, some of which I remember but not statements relating to imputations of personal integrity against me.What is the meaning of the word    unquantifiable damage    used by you in the plaint?I believe that considering my stature, background and reputation, the loss caused to me and my reputation was so enormous that it could be considered unquantifiable.In other words, it was your own personal feeling about your greatness that it cannot be quantified in fiscal measure. What do you have to say?My view about my own reputation was based on what my friends, well-wishers and other people both privately and in the media, who had expressed an opinion on this subject.Court intervenesAnother question pertaining to difference between goodwill and reputation and a suggestion that even a crook enjoys goodwill, was disallowed by the court.",national,India,Politics

Age has withered him but failed to break his indomitable spirit. Dressed carelessly, he stands with a slight stoop, talking affably, shaking hands with people whose paths have crossed his. After about half-an-hour, he has to be coaxed to take his seat at an auditorium, where a film on him is about to be screened.Meet Jack Preger, the 86-year    barefoot    doctor from the U.K. who acquired his medical degree in his 40s following    an inner urge   . Till then, he was happy working on his farm in Wales.His life since then has been anything but a bed of roses. It reads almost like a film-script, which has now been documented in Doctor Jack     One Man, One Life One Fight . The film, by Swiss photojournalist Benoit Lange, was previewed here recently.Early daysDr. Preger has been hounded by locals while trying to treat the poor for free at his pavement clinics, faced deportation from one country, and been jailed in another.    I have stayed in servant quarters,    he says, reminiscing about his early days here. He survived these ordeals, learning some valuable life lessons along the way.His journey as a doctor began in 1971 with the Bangladesh liberation war. He packed his bags and left England, answering a call for medical volunteers required to treat survivors and refugees.The scenes of bloody chaos in the newly born country devastated him and had a profound impact.Throwing himself headlong into helping the vulnerable, he began treating the poor and refugees there for free. Even as he did so, he came across a child-trafficking racket. End result? He was deported from Bangladesh.Remembering those days, he says with a wry smile in the film:    When I was deported, not a single person came to see me off at the airport... I found it very encouraging!   Dropping anchor in Kolkata (then Calcutta), he joined Mother Teresa   s Missionaries of Charity, which he left later.

Aside from run-ins with local goons     to whom the milling crowds were a disruption     Dr. Preger ran into serious trouble only once. He was thrown into Alipore Central Jail due to problems over his travel documents.   The court case went on for eight and a half years, although my jail stay was short,    he chuckles, adding that many joked at that time that his visa problem would not trouble him till the case was resolved. Not one to give up easily, Dr. Preger stood his ground, got registration for his NGO, named Calcutta Rescue, and now runs a number of free clinics that are no longer set up on pavements.There are also two mobile clinics, an arsenic filtration plant in Malda, and two schools (one of which is located in an erstwhile brothel in one of the city   s largest red-light districts). He also runs a handicrafts centre, and a weaving centre that makes gauze and dressing pads, which are used in the clinics.Dr. Preger, who needs to renew his visa annually, does not treat patients anymore.

Mr. Adig has even filed his nomination for the President   s post on four occasions.This time he is contesting two seats: Varanasi South and Varanasi North.    All candidates should consider my long struggle and on moral grounds allow me to win,    says Mr. Adig, bursting into laughter.Though Independent contestants are not very successful     in 2012, only six won in U.P.     they add to the elections shades that the mainstream parties lack. Mr. Adig brings in an unusual flavour. He is fighting with the support of a less-known orthodox Hindu party, the Ram Rajya Parishad, which though non-existent today, won three Lok Sabha seats in the 1952 elections.So what is Adig fighting for? A Ram Rajya, unlike the Hindu Rashtra propagated by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).    Our version will be solely focused on preserving religious sanskriti (culture), justice and truth,    he says.But his main promise to voters is to relieve them of    stress   , which he believes is the biggest cause of crime and wrongful acts.

Singh, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Forests said the government could bring in a notification, after due public consultation, and have rules that define operating parametres for ACs. This was because several places frequently set their air conditioners to extremely low temperatures     irrespective of whether the weather required it to be so     and thereby consumed an excess of electricity.   In Japan, there are regulations that require air-conditioners be set at a specific temperature depending on the season,    Mr. Singh told The Hindu on the sidelines of the conference. Since the summer of 2005, the Japanese Ministry of Environment requires all government departments and commercial establishments to pre-set their air conditioners to 28  C (82  F) during the summer, with employees expected to eschew formal business-wear for comfortable casuals. Mr. Singh added that there would be discussions on the plan but there was no time-frame yet in place to execute the proposal.Chandra Bhushan, Deputy Director General, Centre for Science and Environment, who was part of the discussion panel, said that his organisation had discussed such a plan with the ministry.

Originally brought in as replacements for refrigerant-chemicals but later found to have a high global warming potential, India is one of the largest consumers of HCFCs after China, and is expected to use even more of it because of the projected growth in the sale of air-conditioners.

Activists of the Rajput outfit, Karni Sena, who gained access to the palace posing as tourists, allegedly indulged in vandalism on Sunday.

No one has been arrested so far.Three mirrors in the palace, situated adjacent to a small lake, were installed about 50 years ago. The Rajput group claims that the mirrors misrepresent the story of Queen Padmini, who performed Jahuhar (self-immolation) rather than submitting to Delhi Sultan Alauddin Khilji.The mirrors were shown to tourists as part of a legend that Alauddin Khilji saw Queen Padmini   s face in a mirror while she was seated in a tenement on the other side of the lake, as a compromise with her husband Rana Ratan Singh.Sena   s claimThe Karni Sena dismisses the narrative as spurious and insists that the queen   s face was never shown to the Khilji dynasty ruler.

His arrest is a ploy to suppress a peaceful and democratic agitation,    said a member of the Land and Livelihood Protection Committee that is spearheading the agitation. Locals said there were no incidents of violence so far despite the tension and police had not made fresh attempts to enter the 20 villages.Locals said they were apprehensive of a fresh police crackdown and were keeping a constant vigil at night.

Further, it avoids the preferential treatment offered to Christian refugees in the earlier order.   Here we go again... Muslim Ban 2.0,    Congressman Andre Carson responded.

On the ballot was Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Harvard-educated global technocrat with so much government experience it practically oozed from her pores, and a group of men, most notably the professional soccer player George Weah.Instead of making Ms. Freeman and the other women embarrassed, the heckling only angered them.   You know what?    one of the undecided women told Ms. Freeman, looking at the boys in disgust.    We will vote. Don   t worry, we will vote.   80% voted for SirleafAnd vote they did. Close to 80% of the Liberian women who flooded the polls during the country   s first post-war presidential election voted to usher a woman into power for the first time on a continent that for centuries had been the world   s most patriarchal.The Liberia story is one of extremes. It is almost as if for Liberians to contemplate installing a woman as President, the country needed to first go over a cliff so steep that there seemed nowhere left to drop. Mothers saw their children kidnapped, drugged and forced to take up arms in the country   s never-ending civil war. More than 70% of Liberian women were raped during the war years. Starving young girls gnawed on tree bark for sustenance, while horrified children were forced to watch their sisters, mothers and grandmothers gang-raped in front of them.What happened in the war years so devastated Liberian women, who blamed the men who waged the war for the ensuing horrors, that many of them came to view Ms. Sirleaf not necessarily as the better of the presidential candidates but, rather, as the only alternative to putting a man back in power in a place that men had just run into the ground.De facto slogan   Vote for Woman,    in 2005, became the de facto campaign slogan of Ms. Sirleaf   s run for the presidency. It all started on the morning of May 2, 2005, a week into the voter registration period for the looming presidential elections, when Vabah Gayflor, the Minister for Gender, woke up to discover that women had not been registering to vote. At the other end of the spectrum was Ms. Sirleaf. A former Finance Minister and jailed dissident, she had a pedigree that included the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.She had transformed herself from an abused wife, cowering and hunched in the front seat of her husband   s car while he slapped her, to an international bureaucrat attempting what no woman had ever done before: winning, by popular vote, the right to lead an African country.To the supporters of star athlete Weah, there was no contest. Grandmother versus soccer star? But to women like Ms. Gayflor and Ms. Freeman, there was also no contest.    You will take our country, our baby, and throw the baby away to football player? I beg you, no,    Ms. Gayflor said.NYT",international,Others,

Sreenivasa MurthyV Sreenivasa MurthyPressure is building on the U.K. government to review its approach to international students, as a new study revealed the huge economic contribution they make to the economy, and official figures showed a sharp drop in numbers.International students add around   25.8 billion to the U.K. economy, with their contribution spread across the country, including the more deprived regions, according to research by Oxford Economics for Universities U.K., the body that represents the nation   s universities. According to the research, international students paid   4.8 billion pounds in tuition fees, and billions on goods and services and activities on and off campus. They also helped support around 2,06,600 jobs in the year 2014-2015. Students from non-European Union (EU) countries accounted for a large percentage of fees paid, totalling   4.2 billion.   The spending of international students and their visitors now provides a major export boost for the U.K. economy,    said Julia Goodfellow, President of Universities U.K., adding that there was potential for the U.K. to grow its share of the global market for higher education.   To do this we must present a welcoming climate for genuine international students and ensure that visa and immigration rules are proportionate and communicated appropriately. This will be even more important as the U.K. looks to enhance its place in the world post-Brexit,    she said.According to immigration figures published by the official statistical agency last month, 41,000 fewer international students came to study in the U.K. in 2016, the lowest since 2002. Indians accounted for just 6% of student visas granted in 2016, with a total of 10,798 visas granted. Earlier this year, Indian   s High Commissioner to the U.K., Y.K. Sinha, highlighted the drop, pointing to the fact that many were now choosing other countries, including the U.S., Germany, Australia and France.Major deterrentsPressure has been building for a while now for the U.K. to reform its approach to international students. While there is no cap on the number of students who can come to the U.K., and Britain insists that it welcomes the    brightest and the best   , there are a number of factors that are making Britain a less-attractive destination for Indian students, including restrictions on their ability to work here following the end of their degree.International student numbers are also counted in net migration figures     despite surveys suggesting that three quarters of the British population doesn   t consider international students as migrants.There are also concerns that with the government set on reducing net migration figures, there is little incentive for it to take a more welcoming approach towards students. On the contrary, Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced last year that the government was considering a tougher regime for international students. Further, earlier this year, the government rejected a bid by members of the House of Lords to remove international student numbers from migration figures.",international,UK,

USICS processes more than 85,000 new H-1B visas. The agency has to process amendments and extensions of people who are already in the U.S. on H-1B visas.    As the number of H-1B visa holders in the U.S is increasing every year, the time taken for processing extensions and amendments has shot up in the last couple of years, Ms. Dave said.   Therefore, companies and employees started taking the premium route. An increasing number of premium processing applications further slows down the regular processing, as more and more people pay extra to get the case processed within 15-days, diverting the USICS manpower,    she said.The emphasis on premium processing has stretched the time USICS takes for normal processing of extensions, and these days it is nearing 240 days, the maximum number of days an H-1B visa holder can work in the U.S while waiting for an extension. The USICS has said on Saturday that it was suspending premium processing to clear long-pending cases.Not linked to TrumpMs. Dave said the suspension of premium processing is not linked to Trump administration, but the panic among H-1B holders and companies have resulted in spike in premium petitions in recent months.   Suspension is an internal decision of the USCIS and it does not signal any policy change. However, due to the change in the administration there has been a preference for filing H-1B petitions under the premium route, due to a fear that H-1B policy may change in the future,    she said.   H-1B petitions are usually approved for three years. However in the recent years, USCIS has approved several petitions just for one year. Before the end date on the H-1B petition an extension must be filed. If within the H-1B approved period, the employee changes the company, or the work location of the employee changes within the same company, an H1B amendment needs to be filed. Every year, you have more than 85000 new visas added and the number of total H-1B visa holders is constantly increasing and the number of people seeking such amendments is also increasing,    she said.",international,USA,

It (the definition) needs to undergo change. We (the government) are flexible,    said Ramesh Abhishek, Secretary, Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP) citing feedback from entrepreneurs who submitted that the definition of start-up in the policy hampered their ability to claim benefits.Mr. Abhishek was speaking at an event organised by Indian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association.Mr. Abhishek was referring to the provision in the Start-up India policy which states that for the purpose of claiming the benefits of the government schemes,    start-up    means an entity, incorporated or registered in India: (a) not prior to five years, (b) with annual turnover not exceeding Rs. 25 crore in any preceding financial year and (c) working towards innovation, development, deployment or commercialisation of new products, processes or services driven by technology or intellectual property.   There may not be any need to have a single time period (like five years) and turnover (like Rs. 25 crore) for all sectors. Maybe there is a need to have different time period and different turnover for different sectors,    said the official.He said the government would retain the criterion of    innovation    as it is deliberately kept in the policy to differentiate between a traditional firm and a start-up. However, he added the government would consider suggestions on making the definition of start-up more broad-based.Mr. Abhishek said entrepreneurs from the biotechnology and medical devices sectors have informed the government of the need for relaxation of the five-year time period to eight or ten years as more time was required in such sectors for an entity to take off financially.He said there were also suggestions that instead of    turnover,    the policy should consider the number of employees in a firm or investment in plant and machinery.On the reason for the government looking to review the applications that earlier sought benefits of the start-up policy and were rejected, Mr. Abhishek said,    out of all the applications, only ten start-ups have been approved for availing tax benefit.      I am concerned about this low number and have suggested the need for a review. The mechanism (of the Inter-Ministerial Board, or the IMB, considering the applications) is transparent.   Tax benefitAs per the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion, out of the 1662 applications received so far, only 146 applications can be considered for tax benefits as only these start-ups have been incorporated after April 1, 2016.It added,    out of the 146 applications, all have been considered by the IMB and 10 start-ups have been approved for availing tax benefit.    The    Bharat Navodaya: StartUp India Reform Report,    released on Monday, suggested that the start-up definition be simplified.   Raise threshold      The revenue threshold should be raised; subjectivity should be removed and the additional layer of approval from the IMB should be dispensed with. There should be automatic certification of start-ups upon approval from a few pre-designated bodies,    the reform report recommended.The study also mooted the establishment of a single window clearance for obtaining approvals and licences from all departments, adding that the frequency of filing under labour and tax laws should be reduced.",business,,

We have been having discussions with developers and financiers to see where the NIIF can add value and we will end up with a large pool of capital that will allow us to operate at a scale not common in India today, with sticky capital,    Mr. Bose said.A big milestone was cleared two weeks ago when the Centre signed off on its initial commitment of Rs. 20,000 crore to the NIIF, he added.   We are now in conversation with a couple of sovereign funds to become the first investors and we will expand that conversation with large global pension funds and insurance companies as well,    Mr. Bose said, stressing that this would be sticky, long-term capital unlike volatile global portfolio flows. The anchor investment by the government in NIIF will be split into two buckets     a billion dollars will be earmarked for a    NIIF Direct    fund that could directly invest in existing or new infrastructure firms or projects.Sovereign funds, pension and insurance companies would bring in a similar amount, while the government   s stake would be kept at 49% of this fund, he said.   With the rest of the $2 billion equivalent, we will look to work with fund managers to see if we can create funds that can become partners with us in investing,    he said, speaking at an Indian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association conclave in the capital.$600-billion opportunityIndia is more attractive to foreign investors interested in infrastructure investments in emerging markets as it now has several privately executed projects that are operational or are close to completion, Mr. Bose said.   Some investors prefer post-construction assets, some like to take a risk on construction but require a higher return. There are estimates that about $600 billion equivalent of operating or mostly constructed assets are available,    he said.The NIIF will also back    platform companies    that can scale up and deliver bigger projects as the sector has seen fragmented players, the fund   s chief executive said.   There have not been many large firms coming up. Now we see firms like IDFC alternatives starting the concept of platform companies that can be scalable and become strong counter-parties to government in PPP structures,    said Mr. Bose.",business,,

The country   s premier tea research institution, jointly funded by the government and industry through the Tea Research Association (TRA), has also been defaulting on provident fund payments for its current employees.The more than 100-year-old Tocklai centre at Jorhat in Assam is the hub of tea research in the country and has been funded by the government and industry since 1964.   In this fiscal, Rs. 9.7 crore is pending out of a Rs. 10.5 crore grant,    said Joydeep Phukan, Secretary TRA.    This has led to statutory payments    defaults. About 20 retired scientists and 30 support-staff who have retired have not been paid their PF and LTA dues,    he said, adding that there had been PF defaults for the 220 current employees too.   The PF authorities are threatening to seize Tocklai   s bank accounts if dues remain uncleared after March-end,    he said.The crisis has been triggered by a sharp cut in the 12th plan allocation under R&D and worsened by the plan   s delayed finalisation.There are about 200 scientists at the 10 research stations of TRA conducting scientific and advisory services covering more than 70% of the total tea production.P.

The petitioners have failed to convince the court that the application is maintainable,    NCLT member B. S. V. Kumar said on Monday.    However, instead of dismissing the petition, the court will hear the matter,    he added.Under the new Companies Act, only those entities that hold at least 10% stake in a company can file a petition related to mismanagement and oppression by the management.The petition filed by the Mistry family   s investment companies     Cyrus Investments Pvt. Ltd. and Sterling Investment Corporation Pvt. Ltd.     alleges mismanagement and oppression of minority shareholders by Tata Sons, Ratan Tata and the directors of the holding company of the diversified conglomerate. Mr. Mistry was abruptly removed as the chairman of Tata Sons on October 24, 2016.Incidentally, the issue of maintainability was raised by Tata Sons    senior counsel Abhishek Singhvi when the case came up for hearing on December 22. Mr. Singhvi had argued that the Mistry firms did not own 10% stake and hence the petition was not maintainable. Senior advocate Aryama Sundaram, appearing on behalf of the petitioners, had challenged Tata Sons    contention.While the combined stake of the two investment firms is pegged at about 18.4% of the ordinary equity shares of Tata Sons, the stake falls below 10% if the preference shares are also taken into account. Tata Sons is of the view that the Mistry family firms hold only 2.17% stake in the company.This is the second time that Mr. Mistry has received an unfavourable ruling from the tribunal.Earlier, the NCLT had dismissed a separate contempt petition filed by the Mistry family firms and had directed that the matter be included in the main petition.The contempt petition had sought a stay on Tata Sons    February 6 board meet to consider Mr. Mistry   s removal as a director from the holding company   s board.",business,,

Bhagya PrakashAt tea India was effectively 35 for four. It had managed to erase Australia   s 87-run first innings lead but had lost the important wickets of K.L. Rahul, who was excellent during his 51-run knock, and skipper Virat Kohli. Australia was clearly in the ascendency.However, a wicketless final session, in which Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane put on 91, ensured that Australia wouldn   t run away with the match.   It feels pretty level at the moment,    Josh Hazlewood said.    They fought back really well in that last session. Credit to the two guys. They fought hard and scratched away for quite a bit of runs.   With the pitch slowing down, Nathan Lyon and Steve O   Keefe couldn   t get the ball to turn and bounce as quickly as they did in the first innings. In that scenario, Hazlewood felt that the quicker bowlers could have bowled a better line.   The quicks were a little too wide. In Australia you bowl in that channel outside the off stump, looking for nicks. Obviously it bounces a lot better and there   s a little bit of swing. Here it   s not the case.      With the odd ball shooting through with that up and down bounce, we could be more straighter. There   s not much swing, and not much reverse swing either. You   ve got to bowl stump to stump. I think the Indian quicks bowled really well for a majority of Sunday. We can still improve on today.",sports,,Cricket

It restricted Chhattisgarh to 199 and achieved the target to top the group with 24 points from six consecutive victories.After electing to bat, Chhattisgarh slumped to 60 for four. Nevertheless, Abhimanyu Chauhan (62, 103b, 6x4) applied himself to add 43 runs with captain Mohammad Kaif. Abhimanyu played with a straight bat and placed the ball in the gaps.Despite Kaif retiring hurt on 18 due to discomfort in his right leg, Abhimanyu built another useful partnership of 32 with Amandeep Khare (30, 43b, 3x4, 1x6).Kaif, who returned on Abhimanyu   s departure, forged stands of 26 runs apiece with Khare and Shubham Agarwal (11) and remained not out on 39 (51b, 4x4).Vinay used the morning conditions well to bowl miserly and capture three wickets, while Prasidh picked up two through his fast and accurate yorkers.Karnataka had a bright start as its opening duo of Robin Uthappa (23) and Mayank Agarwal added 52 runs.Mayank played some attractive strokes on both sides to gather 12 boundaries, including eight on the off, in his 76-ball 66.He formed partnerships worth 34 and 62 with Rohan (17) and Manish Pandey (34 off 40) respectively before being caught at gully off Pankaj Rao.Karnataka lost a few quick wickets but didn   t have any trouble in reaching the winning total.The scores: Chhattisgarh 199 in 48.5 overs (Abhimanyu Chauhan 62, Mohammad Kaif 39 n.o., Amandeep Khare 30, R.

There was little doubt about his talent but the fast-tracking of this stroke-player to the team was not appreciated by most.The young middle-order batsman, silenced his critics with a 54-ball 54 that contained six fours and a six.It helped Himmat that he had Unmukt for company as Delhi rebuilt its innings.The pair added 86 runs for the fifth wicket and the partnership saw Delhi get back itself to win the contest.Left-arm bowler Khejroliya, included in the team as a cover for Ashish Nehra, next took over the job with a spell that rocked UP. He accounted for four top-order wickets as UP crashed to an embarrassing 16 for five.Khejroliya removed Prashant Gupta, Akshdeep Nath, Sarfaraz Khan, Saurabh Kumar and Amit Mishra, while Subodh Bhati and Vikas Tokas claimed two wickets each.UP looked to make a fight of it through Rinku Singh (43) and Praveen Kumar (28) but the batting lacked the substance to go the distance. For Delhi, it was a fine end to a poor start in the tournament.The roles played by Chand, Himmat and Khejroliya augur well for the young Delhi team.The scores:Delhi 220 in 48.4 overs (Unmukt Chand 78, Himmat Singh 54, Ankit Rajpoot three for 32) bt Uttar Pradesh 108 in 21.3 overs (Rinku Singh 43, Kulwant Khejroliya five for 22) by 112 runs.",sports,,Cricket

But, Gujarat managed to push out Mumbai by the end of the day as it defeated Bengal in 28 overs for a better run-rate. Thus, Bengal and Gujarat have made it to the quarterfinals from this group.Sagun Kamat scored 23 and Darshan Misal 22, but the rest didn   t fare well, as Goa ran up a score that was too small for Mumbai.

With five wins in six matches, Tamil Nadu took the top slot in the group.After fine knocks by Dinesh Karthik (81) and Ganga Sridhar Raju (77) the Tamil Nadu team cruised thanks to some good work by Aswin Crist (five for 29), M. Mohammed (two for 15) and R. Rohit (two for 23).The focus was clearly on out-batting Tripura which preferred to bowl on a warm day. Shot-making was a judicious task on a pitch where the ball came on nicely. Tripura banked on Abhijit Sarkar and Ajoy Sarkar, but the trusted seamers did not make an impact.The Tamil Nadu top order shared the burden of pushing the run-rate to ultimately achieve the objective of 300-plus. Left-handed Raju was the pick of the batsmen and came up with an innings that showcased his wide range of shots.The composed, diminutive batsman took over the dominant role even as partners Kaushik Gandhi (36, 4x41x6) and B. Aparajith (41, 5x4, 1x6) looked to match his stroke-play.Good standsThe opening partnership of 71 between Gandhi and Raju set the tone for the innings to be launched on a positive note.Raju and Aparajith maintained the run-flow in a 95-run stand for the second wicket before the inform Dinesh Karthik and skipper Vijay Shankar got into the act.Shankar and Karthik   s association was worth 118 in the decisive phase of the match. Karthik hardly played a hurried stroke and Shankar lost his wicket when looking good for much more.Karthik   s 81 off 63 balls contained 11 fours and two sixes while Shankar hit two fours and a six in his 32-ball essay.For Tripura, it was imperative that the team got a flourishing start but three quick blows by Crist put Tamil Nadu on its desired course.Crist continued to revel with his accuracy and again underlined his importance with a five-wicket haul.   He is a wicket-taking bowler in all formats,    coach Hrishikesh Kanitkar had observed.

Bhagya PrakashIndia   s comeback in the second Test remains a work in progress. But Virat Kohli   s men are just a wee-bit ahead and that is a remarkable tale considering the vagaries they suffered on the first two days.The match still hangs in the balance but the third day was largely about India recouping and advancing its chances. The Monday crowd at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium couldn   t have asked for more.At close, India was 213 for four in its second innings and ahead by 126 runs after Australia finished its first innings, in the morning, at 276. That advantage the visitor nursed has been largely chipped away.India gave a far better account of its batting in the second outing. The road to redemption found its initial building blocks through K.L. Rahul and Abhinav Mukund, whose    swivel-and-pull    six off Mitchell Starc, albeit behind the wicket, hinted at optimism.Good standIt was a trait that was amply reflected by Rahul (51, 85b, 4x4), Cheteshwar Pujara (79 batting, 173b, 6x4) and Ajinkya Rahane (40 batting). The last two have added 93 runs in an unfinished fifth-wicket partnership that also yielded a fruitful last session for India: 91 for no loss in 33 overs.Rahul and Abhinav added 39 before the latter was castled by Josh Hazlewood just after lunch. The host dressing room could still breathe easy as Rahul   s footwork and bat-flow were in sync. His partner Pujara     the duo shared a 45-run second-wicket partnership     was a nervous starter and enjoyed a lucky break when Steve Smith grassed him at first slip off Nathan Lyon.Gradually Pujara regained his touch while Rahul   s drives were pleasing, especially one off Starc, and when the bowlers strayed on the leg-side, the flick was immediately unfurled. Rahul reached his 50 in 82 balls and it needed a slice of brilliance to terminate the Bengalurean   s knock.Brilliant effortStriding into his drive off Steve O   Keefe, Rahul edged and the ball was flying past Smith at first slip. In a microsecond, the Australian captain leapt sideways, thrust his right hand and plucked a seemingly impossible catch.The fans, applauding their local hero as he retreated into the dressing room, found extra zing in their vocal chords as Kohli walked in. He was quick off the mark but suffered another cheap dismissal. There was ambiguity about whether Hazlewood   s delivery had grazed his bat before thudding into the pad. Promptly Kohli sought a review and after action replays and close-ups were frozen for almost an eternity, he was adjudged out. India 112 for three, marginally ahead but still not out of the woods.The team-management then promoted southpaw Ravindra Jadeja, a ploy to counter off-spinner Lyon, who was trying to exploit the rough at the Northern End. But Jadeja fell at the Pavilion End, allowing Hazlewood to dismantle the stumps.Alarm bells, though, were muted as Pujara and Rahane played fluently. Balls homing into the stumps or into the rough were kept away and when the bowlers offered width or shortened their lengths, the cuts and sweeps were essayed. Pujara kept threading fours through the off-side while Rahane whipped O   Keefe, the wrists helming the shot.Wrapping it upEarlier, India got the first part of its    Operation Salvage    spot on. Resuming at 237 for six, Australia lasted just 16.4 overs, adding 39 runs while losing its remaining wickets with Jadeja and R. Ashwin sharing the spoils.Jadeja   s six for 63 ensured that the visitor   s tail did not wag and Ashwin prised out Starc. The tail-ender tried to clear mid-wicket and found Jadeja, who then wheeled his bowling arm to scalp the rest and prevented Smith   s men from securing a 100-run lead.These minor statistics can have a major impact. A pulsating Tuesday awaits.",sports,Tamil Nadu,Cricket

Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud spared him from making personal appearances in the future.The court however said it will continue to hear the contempt case on April 17.P.S. Patwalia, who is an Additional Solicitor General, submitted that the unconditional apology features in the very first line of the application filed by Mr. Thakur before the court.   I never intended anything... There is nothing in it... an impression somehow has got created,    Mr. Patwalia sought to explain to the court.He sought an earlier date for the next hearing, sometime in March, saying Mr. Thakur was    pursuing public life.    But the court refused, though it initially advanced the date from April 24 to April 17.On January 2, the Supreme Court had noted that its diktats are not    written in sand    and meant to be complied with while stripping Mr. Thakur and secretary Ajay Shirke of their posts with Indian cricket   s most powerful body.The court had declared Mr. Thakur and Mr. Shirke    unfit    to continue at the helm of the BCCI for their    obstructionist    attitude and specious pleas in court about their incapacity to make affiliated State associations fall in line with the Justice Lodha Committee reforms.Besides, the court found Mr. Thakur prima facie guilty of both contempt of Supreme Court proceedings and perjury (fabrication of false evidence), adding that such a person does not deserve to continue as BCCI president.The court held that Mr. Thakur   s attempts to    solicit    ICC Chairman Shashank Manohar in Dubai for a letter to undermine the Supreme Court judgement of July 18, 2016 which upheld the Lodha Committee recommendation to include a CAG nominee on the Board   s apex council prima facie amounted to sheer contempt.The apex court further said Mr. Thakur was prima facie guilty of placing on record a    fabricated    minutes of a BCCI Working Committee meeting held on August 22, 2016 in order to lend support for his version that he had only sought a clarification from Mr. Manohar and not a letter.The court had issued notice to Mr. Thakur for his response on why he should not face both contempt proceedings and a criminal prosecution for perjury.",sports,,Cricket

http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kohlis-drs-nightmare/article17420196.ece,"Virat Kohli.PTIPTIVirat Kohli and the Decision Review System (DRS) seem to be having an unhappy marriage.If the Indian skipper, who has displayed a rather impulsive streak in reviewing umpiring decisions, thought he finally had a chance on Monday to set it right, even that proved elusive.Kohli was given out leg-before off a Josh Hazlewood delivery which skidded through and thudded onto the pad. Kohli thought he had hit the ball first.The decision was reviewed but even umpteen replays couldn't provide conclusive evidence to overturn the on-field call.   We all were a bit surprised by the call,    said India batting coach Sanjay Bangar.    Was there conclusive evidence to make that call or wasn   t there conclusive evidence that is something the match referee will look into and have a chat about.   The BCCI's official Twitter handle too didn   t want to be left behind.   OUT or NOT OUT ? Richard Kettleborough thought it was out. What do you think ? #Virat @Paytm #INDvAUS,    it tweeted.More importantly, the dismissal ensured that Kohli has totalled only 40 runs in four innings in the series. His reaction after being dismissed was more than indicative of this.   He wanted to succeed very badly in this innings,    said Bangar.    Virat was really pumped up and he is a big match player. But it was a normal reaction of a batsman in the dressing room when he gets out cheaply.   Have all the travails shaken the Indians' confidence in the technology?   I don   t think it has gone to that extent,    he replied.    We are new to DRS and the rules have been tweaked a bit. It is very much the umpire   s call which becomes really, really crucial.   We haven   t really sat down and evaluated it. We are still learning.   Hazlewood said the use of HotSpot would help clear such issues.    It   s a massive series, and you want to have all the technology that you can,    the 26-year-old said.   I think HotSpot works really well. It can be the difference between not out and out. Initially, I just heard a bit of wood, so I pulled out of the appeal. But I saw the guys behind and square of the wicket were pretty confident and it was given out.   After looking at the reviews, you could see the ball was just touching the pad before the bat. So one had to stick with the on-field call.   Bangar, though, said the decision to use HotSpot was best left to the administrators.    It's for them to decide as to why they opted to use a technology and why one part of it is not used,    he said.    I think it is for the ICC, BCCI and other administrators to decide. I have neither the authority nor the knowledge to answer that.   We were a bit surprised. The umpire   s call becomes really crucialSanjay BangarWe were a bit surprised.

http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/two-more-good-sessions-and-we-will-be-ahead/article17420199.ece,"In the series thus far, a brittle Indian batting line-up has meant that the side has seldom been in a position from where it could force the issue. Monday   s final session however was different with Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane, combining to ensure the first wicket-less session of the Test.   The batting group got together and then we had a chat about how our approach had been,    explained India   s batting coach Sanjay Bangar.    We also looked into the past of how we negotiated spin and what were the areas where we could have adapted better. Here the batsmen really applied themselves, used their feet well and were trying to get to the pitch of the ball and also played well on the backfoot. All in all they have put up a better show.   Exciting times ahead   After having not scored enough runs in the first innings, it was good effort to claw our way back and not let the game run away. After the second session, we didn   t lose any wickets and consolidated in the third. Now what lies ahead could be exhilarating stuff.   India in fact tried to wrest the initiative even earlier by promoting Ravindra Jadeja ahead of Rahane.The move, Bangar said, was to ensure a left-right combination. But it failed.   We also wanted to make sure that we get [Nathan] Lyon slightly away from his line of attack. Because whenever a left-hander comes, Lyon generally comes around the wicket and he favours more to bowl outside the rough to the right-hander. Then if an opportunity was there, he could have gone after the left-arm spinner. That was the plan.   Even as he said that the match was still very much in the balance, Bangar felt that two more good sessions on Tuesday could turn the tide.   I think if we put up a good show in the next two sessions then we will slightly have our nose ahead.",sports,,Cricket

That was when my uncle and aunt extended help, taking care of everything and inspiring me to continue playing,    recalls Kunzang.   The first big break came when I was asked to lead the Sikkim under-16 team in the Goa sub-junior Nationals and the selectors were impressed with my performance,    he says.With help from the SAI, he moved to the Delhi League but returned disappointed at not getting too many chances.Then things started looking up for him. He was picked to represent Sikkim at the age of 17 in the 2009 Santosh Trophy. Soon, he played for Royal Wahingdoh FC.   My first stint in the I-League for NEU FC, after playing for Shillong Lajong, was a huge learning curve. It exposed me to what it means to be a quality footballer,    he recalls.He made five appearances in the I-League and it was enough for him to earn a call-up from Atletico de Kolkata for the 2015 ISL season.   It was a huge opportunity to play for Atletico for one season,    says Kunzang, who nurses the dream of playing in the European League.   That   s why I joined Fateh Hyderabad last November, and I am pleased with the kind of support and facilities being extended to the players. In terms of football culture, the city might lag behind many other States, but hats off to the Fateh officials and also the Telangana Football Association for making sincere efforts to revive the game in a big way here,    he said.What was Bhaichung   s advice to this Bhutia?

The unfortunate incident here obviously marks a new low in Delhi cricket and demands a disciplinary inquiry from the DDCA and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as well.   Is Gambhir not supposed to be a role model being a World Cup winner?    asked a former Delhi star.The cause of Gambhir   s acerbic outburst was not known, but it was obvious the former India opener, with an aggregate of 14,205 runs from 186 First Class matches, is peeved at the appointment of Bhaskar ahead of his preferred candidate.The Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) had appointed Ajay Jadeja last season in place of Vijay Dahiya and Gambhir had expressed displeasure.Eventually Jadeja had withdrawn from the appointment and senior players Rajat Bhatia and Mithun Manhas had shifted to other States.Gambhir, observers point put, has had a series of spats with senior cricketers, including Chetan Chauhan, Hari Gidwani and Venkat Sundaram, but this episode beats them all.Gambhir reportedly mocked Bhaskar   s cricket credentials     95 First Class matches and an aggregate of 5,443 runs     and did not even spare his son, Ruushil Bhaskar, who played junior cricket for Delhi and Haryana.Delhi selectors had recently sacked Gambhir as Delhi captain.

The fast bowler thus becomes the second addition to the RPS contingent through trading, after Mayank Agarwal   s transfer from Delhi Daredevils during the pre-auction window.Thakur   s three-year association with Kings XI Punjab turned out to be far from productive as the Mumbai pace spearhead fetched drinks for a majority of the last three seasons.

Last year, he was released from the squad midway through the tournament.For the last year, Thakur has been a standby in India   s Test squad.

He has been working on improving his performance in limited overs    cricket for the last couple of years. His stellar show during the just-concluded league stage of the Vijay Hazare Trophy inter-state one-day tournament is a testimony to the fact that he has developed his skills in the shorter formats.With 16 wickets from six games, Thakur finished as the joint second-highest wicket-taker in the league stage of the tournament. In fact, Thakur   s consistent show     along with Dhawal Kulkarni and Rohit Sharma   s comeback after a prolonged injury layoff     was the highlight of Mumbai   s campaign, which ended on a disappointing note with the team failing to qualify for the knockout stage on the basis of net run rate.It is understood that Thakur, on the pretext of getting game time during the IPL, jumped over the prospects of playing for the Pune team.

Goel served the Chhattisgarh skipper a warning and ordered deduction of his match fees.Chasing 200 to win, Karnataka was three for no loss when Mayank Agarwal, on one, edged one behind off Omkar Verma. The Chhattisgarh team appealed vociferously for a catch.Umpire Virender Sharma consulted his on-field colleague at square leg Umesh Dubey before giving his decision in favour of the batsman.Instinctively, Kaif urged the umpires to seek a television referral. However, the umpires preferred to stick to their decision.Shockingly, Kaif ordered his teammates to leave the field in protest of the decision.Almost the whole team left the field forcing Goel to intervene.Goel, who understandably had access to the video footage of the action in the middle, managed to pacify Kaif within minutes following which the Chhattisgarh team resumed play.The incident, which held up play for eight minutes, was not an ideal example for the younger cricketers of Chhattisgarh, playing domestic cricket in its debut season.Besides, it was a disappointing episode for the sparse gathering at the ground.",sports,,Cricket

http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/usefulness-of-vedic-teachings/article17420389.ece,"The study of the Vedas is the starting point to any spiritual aspirant. One who follows the Vedic teachings is sure to find ways to fulfil many aspirations in this world and in other worlds as well.But the knowledge of the Vedas with respect to these matters is far from useful to one whose aim is attainment of Brahma Jnana, is what the Gita reiterates, pointed out Srimati Rukmini Ramamurthy in a discourse. One who lives in a place where there is only a well or a pond will have to be satisfied with the water that is thus available. But by chance if he comes to know that water is available in plenty elsewhere, it is most unlikely that he would settle down for well water alone for his requirement.By extension, it follows that if one comes to know of the prospect of everlasting bliss that far supersedes all these earthly joys that are after all ephemeral, will he not opt for it? Scriptures try to make an inquiry into the kind of happiness enjoyed by the various classes of beings, whether human or divine. If, for instance, the basic unit of bliss is taken as the earthly happiness enjoyed by one who is young, handsome, learned, healthy, strong of mind, wealthy and has been endowed with all human enjoyments, it is shown that it becomes progressively higher in the various grades of divine beings such as gandharvas, devas, Indra, Bruhaspati, Prajapati and so on. They conclude that the supreme state of bliss that the knowledge of Brahman confers is far superior to what is available or thought of as happiness in human terms. It is beyond the grasp of the mind and the senses and is perfect, complete, infinite and absolute. This is attainable to him who is able to transcend his ignorance of the true nature of happiness.",sports,,Others

Bhagya PrakashThe war of words between India and Australia moved from the turf to the boardroom as both Cricket Australia and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) issued statements backing their respective teams and their captains.The concluding day of the second Test here at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium had witnessed high drama, where Steve Smith, after admitting to have tried receiving inputs from the dressing room before deciding on an umpiring review, called it a    brain fade    and a one-off only to be sharply contradicted later by Virat Kohli.   I saw that happening two times when I was batting,    Kohli had said.    I pointed out to the umpire that I   ve seen their players looking upstairs for confirmation. We also told the match referee that they   ve been doing that for the last three days and this had to stop.   Cricket Australia, in a statement released at 12.55 p.m. IST on Wednesday, sought to rebut this allegation that Smith   s was not an isolated incident. It also stated that there was no dishonest motive behind his actions.   We reject any commentary that suggests our integrity was brought into disrepute or that systemic unfair tactics are used, and stand by Steve and the Australian Cricketers who are proudly representing our country,    said James Sutherland, CEO, Cricket Australia,   I find the allegations questioning the integrity of Steve Smith, the Australian Team and the dressing room, outrageous. Steve is an outstanding cricketer and person, and role model to many aspiring cricketers and we have every faith that there was no ill-intent in his actions,    he added.Australia coach Darren Lehmann too vehemently denied the charges.   Never, ever, ever. Very surprised to hear that, but it   s their opinion,    Lehmann told the travelling Australian media.    He [Kohli] has his opinion and we have ours, but at the end of the day we play the game the right way. We   ve never done any of that, so we   ll just get on with the next game.   Change in mindsetLehmann also said that this Australian team was far removed from those he was part of which would have responded aggressively to Kohli   s charge.   Gone are the days when we used to be probably the other way, and I was part of that as an Australian side. The young guys, the way they want to portray themselves and encourage people to play the game and enjoy the game has been exceptional.   The BCCI statement, sent nearly three hours after Cricket Australia   s, supported Kohli in equally clear terms but provided no evidence to substantiate his claims on the two other incidents.It referred only to the episode which played out in full view and asked the International Cricket Council (ICC)    to take cognisance of the fact that the Australian skipper Mr. Steve Smith in his press conference admitted to a    brain fade    at that moment.      The BCCI, after due deliberation and seeing the video replays of the episode, steadfastly stands with the Indian team and its captain,    it said.   Mr. Virat Kohli is a mature and seasoned cricketer and his conduct on the field has been exemplary. His action was supported by ICC Elite Panel umpire Mr. Nigel Llong who rushed in to dissuade Mr. Steve Smith from taking recourse to inappropriate assistance.   A link to the video clip of the incident and the press conference which followed were provided at the end of the release.No action, says ICCThe ICC said    no further action    would be taken against the skippers, but the match referee would bring them together ahead of the next Test    to remind them of their responsibilities to the game.",sports,,Cricket

That is completely unheard of. The last time I thought that to happen was in an Under-10 game, when my coach used to suggest where point fielders and cover fielders used to stand.

In addition, the layout of the 17th and 18th holes demands a cool head for a strong finish. On the par-5 18th, long-hitters can use the steep slope with a hope of getting on to the green in two. Otherwise a well-measured lay-up from the top of the fairway should find the preferred landing area which is a few storeys below.Thereafter, an approach-shot over the water is needed to reach the green. Indeed, such a testing final hole has enhanced the intrigue factor.The first nine holes, called the    Lake Nine   , are understandably dominated by water besides an island green on the par-3 fifth hole. The back nine, known as the    Quarry Nine    features a large lake and since it is built around a quarry, the man-made rock formations add to the intimidating look of the course.With the course ready to throw up a few surprises, the title-aspirants are understandably guarded in their approach. Lahiri summed up the ensuing challenge very well.    It   s basically a ball-striker   s course. It   s going to be a challenge for sure. I mean it   s not something that you come across very often.   Much depends on how they set up the golf course. Pace of play is going to be a concern and if it gets windy it   s going to be extremely hard.   Should it favour the overseas golfers, Rafa, the European Ryder Cup player, Australians Scott Hend and Brett Rumford could be among the front-runners on Sunday.Hend heads the Asian Tour Order of Merit while Rumsford is fresh from winning his sixth European Tour title following his triumph last month in the ISPS HANDA World Super 6 Perth championship.Apart from Lahiri and defending champion S.S.P. Chowrasia, the Indians capable of catching the eye this week are last year   s double international winner Gaganjeet Bhullar, former champions Jyoti Randhawa and Arjun Atwal, the seasoned Jeev Milkha Singh who is looking for his maiden Open, Shiv Kapur, youngsters like Shubhankar Sharma, Rashid Khan, S.

Parthiv replied,    It   s been good, I got around 700 runs.    Ganguly   s response was sharp. He said,    This you do every season.   At first, Ganguly   s comment appeared casual for Parthiv. Then the enormity of what the celebrated Indian captain said hit him.    What he meant was I should not be content with what I was doing, needed to do something out of the ordinary to win back my place in the Indian squad,    Parthiv said in a conversation with The Hindu here recently.The wicketkeeper-batsman realised he needed to shed weight, improve his glovework and begin dominating the bowling.   I then underwent a rigorous morning-to-evening training and practice schedule in the Motera Stadium. I would do stringent fitness routines, practise my    keeping and then work on my batting,    he said.Parthiv realised that his mistakes as a    keeper, most of them in the last session of the day, were not due to any faulty technique.   My fitness levels were not quite there and this affected my concentration in the final session where I put down catches,    he admitted.The left-handed Parthiv, to whom the cut, pull and sweep come naturally, faced difficulties when bowlers, comprehending his game, pitched the ball up.   I worked on my drives through mid-off and mid-on, often practising alone with the bowling machine.   The diminutive Parthiv, who shed 10kg coming down to 65 from 75, also dieted, cutting out on fat and sugar.Every three weeks, he would travel to Chennai to get himself assessed by strength and conditioning guru S. Basu.Gradually, Parthiv turned the corner.   The results came slowly but when they did, I was a better cricketer.   Parthiv returned to the Indian team against England this season     he batted and    kept more than usefully     and then led Gujarat to a historic maiden Ranji title. All the effort had paid off.He recalled India coach Anil Kumble knocking on his door on the eve of the Mohali Test and telling him    You are going to open tomorrow, I know you can do it.   Reassuring wordsParthiv said,    Anil Bhai   s words were so reassuring since I was playing a Test after eight years.   The 31-year-old Parthiv responded with innings of 42 and 67 not out at Mohali and then made a strokeful 71 in Chennai     all as an opener.When Parthiv first played for India in 2002 in England, it was in a different era.    Sachin Sir, Dravid Sir, Ganguly Sir, Laxman Sir and Anil bhai, they were all there.   The first few days I would observe one legend a day from my corner in the dressing room, just see how he went about his work.

Bhaskar, who faced humiliation at the hands of Gautam Gambhir.Bedi, who is in Bengaluru to attend the BCCI awards function, termed the incident    appalling    and expected disciplinary proceedings against Gambhir.    Cricket, whether at domestic or international level, does not deserve to be brought down to this level. I feel sorry for Bhaskar,    he said.   Man of impeccable credentials,    was how Shastri described Bhaskar, who chose not to comment on the incident.Shastri added,    I have played enough cricket with Bhaskar and known him well enough to understand his credentials. He was a superb cricketer who deserved to have worn the India cap.   There is no place for such behaviour and it ought to be condemned outright. It should be dealt with firmly by the authorities and not just at the DDCA. There should be zero tolerance for such behaviour.   Wassan said he felt sad for the Delhi coach.    I am not surprised by his behaviour or comments. I only feel sad for Bhaskar because he did not deserve this. It was the lowest moment in Delhi cricket because this was not argument as the player has claimed. In my opinion such people are most unfit to be in a team sport,    Wassan observed.Former Delhi selector Hari Gidwani, too, narrated his unpleasant experience.    He never lost an opportunity to humiliate me in selection meetings with the chairman (Vinay Lamba) a mute spectator. He even questioned my cricketing merit,    said Gidwani, who served two years as National junior selector and played 119 first-class matches.Meanwhile, Azad, has demanded an inquiry into the episode.",sports,,Cricket

His first goal game in the 44th minute and the second in the 68th. But what happened in the intervening period was the story of the day.The 30-year-old, who once played for HAL in the erstwhile National Football League, collapsed because of respiratory problems minutes after the start of the second-half. Referee Stanley Jones stopped the match and an ambulance was summoned.Brief treatmentBut after a brief treatment on the sidelines from the doctor and the physio, Nandakumar miraculously returned.    I had no problems in the first-half,    he recalled.   While running out for the second half, I had breathing problems. Then I fell down. I couldn   t speak for 30 to 40 seconds. Then the physiotherapist and doctor treated me.   When asked if it was not his life that took precedence, Nandakumar said    Football is my life. I have been playing for 16 to 17 years.      My team situation is like that. We are fighting relegation. The coaches asked me not to [continue]. But I wanted to play.      I later went to the hospital. Got treatment. I am ready to play even tomorrow.   M.S. Krishnamurthy, the Referees Committee chairman, said that Nandakumar was allowed to comeback only after the doctors    clearance.   It was just giddiness. He was not entirely unconscious,    said Krishnamurthy.    If it was that, he would have never been allowed to come back. The referee decided that his life would not be in danger. So we allowed.

http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rate-ashwin-higher-than-bhajji/article17431852.ece,"N. Shivlal Yadav.V_V_SUBRAHMANYAMR. Ashwin is a trier and never sits back to let things happen, he creates situations. This is what separates him from the rest of the crowd and makes him the best off-spinner now, says former India off-spinner N. Shivlal Yadav.Reflecting on Ashwin   s stupendous success at the highest level, Shivlal, who himself was a classy exponent with 102 wickets from 35 Tests between 1979 and 1987, says that the former is the most complete bowler now.   It is never easy to bowl on a pitch like the one in the Bengaluru Test against Aussies.   Bowling straighter ones and coming up with such variations requires great craft. He has really mastered this art,    Shivlal said.   Personally, I rate Ashwin higher than Bhajji (Harbhajan Singh) for he flights the ball more and has a very good loop despite his height whereas the latter was much flatter and faster through the air,    the former BCCI president pointed out.Shivlal does not agree with the criticism that Ashwin has not been as successful abroad as he is in India.    He did bowl well in Australia, the West Indies. There may not have been so many big hauls. But the fact remains he bowled well. Sometimes you bowl much better but don   t get too many wickets,    he said.   Rodney Hogg, Terry Alderman (came) to India and struggled after taking lots of wickets at home and in England. But, their failure doesn   t mean they were not great bowlers,    he said.Shivlal feels left-armer Ravindra Jadeja is the most dangerous on the kind of pitches being prepared for Tests now in India.    The huge element of surprise as no-one knows whether ball is spinning into the batsman or turning away because of his trajectory,    he said.   This is the key to his success. He is a perfect foil to Ashwin and this is what makes them such a formidable combination if not the best spin duo we have ever had,    said Shivlal.   We never got these kind of tracks during our playing days. They were generally flat except once against Pakistan in the Bengaluru Test in 1987 (Sunil Gavaskar   s last Test which the host lost). Wish we had these kind of wickets,    remarked the former India off-spinner.   And, the rules too have changed a lot. In those days, if you bowl round the wicket, there was no way of getting an lbw. Now, even on front foot you are getting favourable lbw decisions,    Shivlal said.On Aussie off-spinner Nathan Lyon, Shivlal said that the Aussie had a nice loop and good control over his line length.    But, he is not the same threat on better wickets as he is on turners,    he added.On turning tracks   Indian batting failure on turning tracks is nothing new. Even in the past we succumbed to the guile of John Bracewell, Phil Edmonds, Greg Mathews, Pat Pocock to name a few,    said Shivlal.   I feel it is always better to prepare wickets which have slow wear and tear and not spin from day one. This kind of strategy does boomerang on us as the rivals too can seize on the chances,    he felt.   That is why winning the toss on these turners is winning half the battle itself. I wish better tracks were prepared in Ranchi and Dharamshala for the next two Tests. And you cannot write off Aussies for they are always such a fighting unit,    Shivlal concluded.",sports,,Cricket

Madhu is the chairman of the committee and BPCL Sports Officer R. Rajeev is the convener, while former Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax N.C. Chacko, Cochin Port Trust Traffic manager Raj Vinod and Karthikeyan are its other members. Apart from State player Karthikeyan, all the others are former internationals.   Basheer   s adverse comments against Arjuna awardees and Tom Joseph were just the spark that made us fight back, but he had come up with a lot of things that had been against players    interests in the last few years,    said Rajeev at the media conference which included former internationals Tom and Kishore Kumar.   The VFI has sent this letter about the ad-hoc committee to the Kerala State Sports Council. We are prepared to disband the committee in case Basheer resigns, as we had demanded earlier, or if elections which are due this year are held in the State association, in which case many former players will contest the elections.   Rajeev also revealed that initial discussions to conduct a Kerala Volley League have been completed and a sports group has shown interest in investing Rs. 5 crore in the event.    It could happen within the next six to eight months,    he said.He also made it clear that the ad-hoc committee would not interfere with tournaments that had been sanctioned by KVA secretary Basheer earlier and which are scheduled to run within the next few months in Kerala.   We will not suspend such tournaments nor will we take action against players who play there because we understand that to conduct a tournament, organisers need to prepare for at least three to five months and as volleyball lovers, we don   t want to trouble them,    said Rajeev.    We will also advise organisers not to pay any royalty money to the KVA for tournaments and if they have already paid this, they should try to get the money back. We will not be taking royalty for tournaments, instead we will try to support organisers   .When contacted for his reaction, Nalakath Basheer said that the VFI (secretary Ramavtar Singh Jakhar   s faction) had terminated the services of its president at an emergency executive committee meeting in Chennai in March last year.",sports,,Others

Vedhan.Chennai City played its heart out to hold defending champion Bengaluru FC 1-1 in a Hero I-League match at the Nehru Stadium here on Wednesday.Bengaluru FC, which had plenty of goal-scoring opportunities, remains at fifth position with 17 points.A flag-kick by Marjan Jugovic saw Sunil Chhetri head it to Australian Juan Antonio, whose forceful header again hit the forehead of Debabrata Roy who stood near the goal-line. In injury time, Jugovic   s header looked like going into the net, but the City defence cleared the danger. City was lucky to score its first goal when a Soosai Raj cross from the right was inadvertently headed home by John Johnson.With its pride severely dented, the visitor hit back in style immediately. Udanta Singh ran in from the right and sent in a searing cross. City   s goalkeeper Karanjit Singh dived to put the ball away, but it went straight to Daniel Lalhlimpuia, who shot it home.The two-time champion flattered to deceive in the first half. It stitched together nice and purposeful passes, but failed miserably in the final third. Chhetri and Udanta were quick and dribbled past the midfielders with ease. In a nice one-two between Chhetri and Mandar, the former deftly passed it to Mandar but he shot it wide.City was forced to defend deep as BFC keep coming hard at it. Ravanan and Anyichie Celestine did a commendable job at the heart of the defence. City started with Raegan and Brazil   s Charles De Souza upfront. The Tamil Nadu striker wasted a great opportunity to make a mark as he failed to combine well with the Brazilian.

Engineer, who delivered the fifth MAK Pataudi Memorial Lecture here on Wednesday, suggested    having an elite cricket board   , involving some of India   s greatest players.   You have the likes of (Ravi) Shastri, (Anil) Kumble, (VVS) Laxman, (Javagal) Srinath, Sachin (Tendulkar), (Dilip) Vengasrkar, (Sunil) Gavaskar, many to choose from,    Engineer said.

We not only want but demand nothing but the best for Indian cricket.   Engineer offered his take on the problem of doctored pitches.    Someone has proposed neutral curators.

I used to get 50 rupees per day as fees for a Test match; do you hear that Virat?    he asked.   Gavaskar and I were once batting against Sri Lanka with us about to win the match in four days. We got messages from the dressing room asking us to take it to the fifth day, so that we'd get another 50 rupees.

It is considered to be the higher knowledge by which one knows the changeless Reality. It is knowledge that is all-pervading and subtler than the subtlest, everlasting, and the source of all, say the Upanishads.In contrast to this is the knowledge of the intellect and senses which is limited to the objective and finite world. One may go in search of this knowledge from many external sources; but the knowledge thus gained can never really belong to him. He may lose it at any time. But Atma Vidya is its own possession. None can take it away.In a discourse, Swami Paramasukhananda pointed out that all the subtle effects and facets of Atma Vidya are exemplified in King Prithu when he is blessed by the arrival of the Sanatkumaras.These four great sages headed by Sanaka arrive to impart their sermon to the king. He is overwhelmed by his good fortune, for he had been instructed by Lord Narayana earlier. He is already a realised soul for he sees the presence of the Almighty in all aspects of creation. Though a ruler with a vast kingdom, he knows that nothing at all belongs to him. There is nothing he needs at a personal level and so he rules the kingdom in the most righteous manner. He is thus free of the sense of    I    and    Mine.   Now he is blessed by the sages who are the most invaluable teachers and have come to impart the highest ever attainment for any jivatma, the knowledge of the self. What guru dakshina can be given to such selfless preceptors, except one   s heartfelt gratitude, says Prithu. Moreover is there anything at all to be given to such preceptors who are the very essence of altruism in their state of self knowledge?",sports,,Others

CSCs are designed to be the hub Centre of activities in rural India,    the Minister for Electronics and IT Ravi Shankar Prasad said.    The government is focused on expansion of CSCs because of their inherent strength to transform rural India. With the sale of FMCG products, the door has been opened for popularising e   commerce through CSCs.   There are more than 2.5 lakh CSCs across the country which enable people, particularly in rural areas, to access government services online. These services include ration card, birth certificate, train tickets and online form submission, among other things.Going beyond delivery of public services through such centres, the Centre is now opening up to tie-ups with private companies for their products to be sold through CSCs to increase profits for Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs). For example, CSC also has a tie up with Videocon d2h and Reliance Jio to sell their connections.   There is an increasing demand for FMCG products in villages, so it was decided to use the vast network of CSCs to sell these products. People in villages can come to these centres and place order for the products they want online,    Dr. Dinesh Kumar Tyagi, CEO of CSC e-Governance Services India told The Hindu .The move will help VLEs who run CSCs to earn commission on the products sold while also enabling access for customers in rural areas to these products. According to estimates, a VLE is likely to earn a commission in the range of 12-20% on FMCG products, which is far higher than less than 10% on other services offered.Higher marginsCurrently, by offering these online services, these centres together earn commission of more than Rs. 2 crore a day. The Centre is eyeing to ramp this up to Rs. 10 crore a day.   The tie-up with FMCG companies will help them do more business as the margins are higher. Usually taking franchise for a brand like Patanjali costs a lot. But here we on behalf of the VLEs try to get the best deal for them,    Mr. Tyagi said.He added that all the back-end and logistics would be taken care of by the CSCs.",business,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/tata-steel-closes-old-uk-pension-scheme/article17431231.ece,"Tata Steel is to close its long running   15 billion defined benefit U.K. pension scheme to future accrual at the end of March.   From April 1 2017, employees will save for their retirement through a new and competitive defined contribution scheme,    according to a BSE filing on Wednesday.Tata Steel consulted over 4,000 employees and also held discussions with unions during the course of its consultations on the issue.Last month members of the three main unions representing the majority of Tata Steel workers voted in favour of accepting reforms to Tata Steel   s pension arrangements, in return for Tata Steel proposals to keep the blast furnace at Port Talbot open for at least five years with no compulsory redundancies and investing   1 billion over a 10-year period.Defined benefit pensionTata Steel will replace the defined benefit pension scheme with a defined contribution scheme with maximum contributions from the company of 10% and employees of 6%.   Closing the pension scheme is a necessary condition but it   s only a necessary condition and that is the easy bit,    says John Ralfe, an independent pension consultant.   The thing that has to be addressed and the other necessary condition is separating the   15 billion pound scheme from Tata Steel entirely,    he said. In addition, the eagerness of the scheme   s trustees to keep it out of the pension protection fund     which covers members of pension schemes that fall into insolvency     made things more complicated and potentially more costly for Tata Steel.   They want it to be a self sufficient, self standing entity and that is exponentially more difficult,    he said.The company said it continued to be    deeply engaged    with the trustees, unions and regulatory and government bodies to find a    fair and practical outcome    for members of the scheme.   The company believes that finding a structural solution to address the risks from the pension scheme to the viability of the business is a crucial part of its ongoing U.K. transformation plan.   The issue of Tata Steel   s pension liabilities have been a long-running headache for the business. In 2015 the company had a major stand off with unions over the future of the pension scheme, eventually backing down on plans to replace the generous defined benefit scheme at that time.Liberty HouseAside from the deal struck with unions to close the scheme, Tata Steel has also taken other steps, including, agreeing to sell its speciality steel business to Sanjeev Gupta   s Liberty House Group for   100 million. It has also sold its long products business to Greybull Capital.Last year, Tata Steel said it would be putting plans to sell its strip products on hold, and launched discussions with ThyssenKrupp over a merger. However, talks have dragged on, largely because of concerns about pension liabilities.",business,,

Demand was just a little more than 600 tonnes in the last calendar year.Incidentally, the year 2016 saw gold demand in India falling to its lowest level since 2009 as government policies along with weak rural sentiment kept consumers away.   It   s clear that India   s gold market faces short-term headwinds,    the WGC said in a report.    But looking ahead, these policies promise to deliver a stronger and more transparent economy. This will support gold demand, which we expect to be between 650-750t in 2017,    it said.While the gold trade body said that the outlook for 2017 was    cautious   , it added that demand was likely to improve going forward.Greater transparency   Over time, we anticipate that economic growth and greater transparency within India   s gold market will push demand higher: by 2020 we see Indian consumers buying between 850t and 950t,    according to the report. It added earlier attempts by the authorities to clamp down on gold had failed as gold is too intimately ingrained in the Indian society.The global body further stated that while demonetisation did dent economic growth, it was helping large jewellery retailers and consumers in terms of transparency and quality.   Demonetisation is also boosting large jewellery retailers, and they will continue to grab a larger share of the market. Over time, consumers will move away from cash towards digital payments, and organised players should benefit from this trend. This change in market dynamics will result in more transparency and a better deal for consumers, protecting them from shady practices such as under   carating,    the WGC said.Further, while the government had put a cap of Rs. 3 lakh on cash transactions starting April 1, the Council was of the view that while it could hamper gold purchases, consumers might buy the precious metal in smaller quantities or might also look at the black market to bypass the regulations.   Promote black market      It could curb gold purchases, it could just encourage gold shoppers to buy smaller amounts of gold spread over more transactions, or it could push a large part of demand underground and encourage growth in the black market,    according to the WGC.Interestingly, WGC, conducted a consumer research in the first quarter of 2016 in which 63% of respondents in India agreed with the statement    I trust gold more than the currencies of countries   .",business,,

As a first step, the Democratic People   s Republic of Korea (DPRK) may suspend its nuclear and missile activities in exchange for the suspension of large-scale U.S.-Republic of Korea (ROK) military exercises,    Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a media conference on the sidelines of the annual session of the National People   s Congress.This will help the parties to break out of the security dilemma and return to the negotiating table, he observed.    We may follow the dual-track approach of denuclearising the peninsula on the one hand and establishing a peace mechanism on the other.   The Chinese Foreign Minister compared the missile tests of the North and the joint drills across the border in South Korea to two    accelerating trains coming toward each other   .    Holding nuclear weapons won   t bring security, using military force won   t be a way out,    Mr. Wang said, in a message to Pyongyang and Seoul.    There remains a chance of resuming talks, there is still hope for peace.   Mr. Wang stressed that the DPRK and the U.S. were the main parties to the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, but as a next-door neighbour with a lips-and-teeth relationship with the Peninsula, China   s role in the resolution of the issue was indispensable.In response to a question, Mr. Wang highlighted that the Brazil- Russia-India-China-South Africa (BRICS) grouping was set for deepening its engagement with the Global South under a BRICS-plus approach.Dialogue partnershipHe stressed that under the stewardship of China, which will host the BRICS summit this year, the emerging-country bloc will explore establishing a dialogue partnership with other major developing countries.    We will widen the circle of friends of the BRICS and turn it into the most influential platform for south-south cooperation in the world.   At a time when the U.S. appeared to be looking inwards, the Chinese Minister affirmed that his country would champion inclusive globalisation, within the framework of the UN. He said President Xi Jinping   s January visit to international organisations had sent out a clear message that China strongly supported multilateralism, along with its abiding commitment to the UN-centred multilateral system.   In China   s view, the current international system was built by our forefathers from the ashes of the Second World War. It is a result of our common effort and wisdom. It is like a well-designed building with multilateralism as its cornerstone and the UN and other international organisations as important pillars.   In his free-wheeling annual press conference that lasted nearly two hours, Mr. Wang signalled Beijing   s support for a trilateral relationship among China, Russia and the United States.

I know it   s possible because I   ve seen it happen,    she said in an interview with The Hindu on International Women   s Day, ahead of the launch of the Commonwealth   s Peace in the Home initiative targeted at reducing domestic violence across member-states by double-digit percentages.Baroness Scotland pointed to the progress that had been made in the U.K. between 2003 and 2010, which had reduced rates of domestic violence by 64%.    Anything the U.K. can do, the other 51 countries can do. If we pool our resources, our knowledge of what works and what doesn   t work, we can make a real difference.    The U.N. estimates that around one in three women has been the subject of domestic violence of one form or another.Alongside initiatives     that include a tool-kit to help governments and other sectors work together on tackling domestic violence     the Commonwealth will also conduct research on the economic costs of domestic violence, which    disproportionately    impacts women, she said, arguing that this would help take focus away from concerns that cash-strapped governments might have about costs of anti-domestic violence initiatives.    These people who are suffering will have to go to hospital... they may not do so well at school     you can see how it impacts businesses... it   s a cost to the whole economy. The question so many governments are asking is: I have no money, how can I do this? And we are saying: let   s not look at how much you need to spend, let   s look at how much you are already spending.   Campaign centrepiecesAmong the things that will form a centrepiece of the campaign is a    bench book    targeted at helping judges put national laws on domestic violence in the context of international human rights legislation     already trialled in East Africa. Targeted versions for regions across the Commonwealth, including Asia, would be rolled out, she said.    Judges have said... it gives them continuity and information... all our countries are common law countries and our judges are trained in similar ways, we interpret laws similarly, our parliamentary structures are similar, if we can work out what works for one of us, it   s highly likely it will work for the rest of us.   The Commonwealth already has one that helps medical practitioners identify the signals of domestic violence, but hope to generate greater awareness and use of it..    I have spoken to so many leaders and so many ministers in government and this issue about violence is also an issue about our children: it   s affecting millions and millions of children. If we can let our children see that violence should be the last port of call for dispute resolution and not the first we will do an amazing amount to ending violence in our world.",international,Scotland,

After the Snowden disclosures, the Obama administration worked hard to re-establish relationships and government-industry partnerships,    said David Gutelius, chief executive of the marketing technology company Motiva, who has worked with the federal government on national security projects.    This leak will challenge those ties to some extent. But I don   t see companies simply walking away from the table as a result of this. Government and industry still need one another.   Ceding groundThe tense relationship between the technology industry and government agencies has been well documented. After the disclosures by Mr. Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency, the government appeared to give some ground to the industry, which was angered by previously unknown snooping on their products and embarrassed by disclosures of their cooperation with intelligence agencies.The government allowed companies to describe in broad terms the number of secret court orders for access to customer information that they receive. President Barack Obama also promised that the government would share knowledge of security flaws so that they could be fixed.But last year, relations soured again after Apple resisted a Justice Department request for help accessing the iPhone of one of the attackers in the 2015 shooting in San Bernardino, California. As the company   s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, explained in a letter to customers at the time,    The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers.   In that case, the government eventually found a way into the phone without Apple   s assistance.Security flawsThe documents posted by WikiLeaks suggest that the CIA had obtained information on 14 security flaws in Apple   s iOS operating system for phones and tablets.The leaked documents also identified at least two dozen flaws in Android, the most popular operating system for smartphones, which was developed by Alphabet   s Google division.It is unclear how many of the vulnerabilities described by WikiLeaks still exist. Some of the flaws listed date back several years and have been fixed.The documents released by WikiLeaks reveal numerous efforts by the CIA to take control of Microsoft Windows, the dominant operating system for personal computers, using malware. They include techniques for infecting DVDs and USB storage devices with malware that can be spread to computers when they are plugged in.   We   re aware of the report and are looking into it,    Microsoft said in a statement.Security experts said it was not surprising that the government had stockpiled flaws in major technology products to use for spying.    The real scandal and damaging thing is not knowing these things exist, but that the CIA could be so careless with them that they leaked out,    said Matthew D. Green, an assistant professor in the department of computer science at Johns Hopkins University.Inside technology companies, the revelations set off a scramble to assess the potential damage to the security of their products. The vulnerabilities, some of which were already known in the security community, could leave individual users of computers, mobile phones and other devices open to being snooped on. Technology companies are likely to plug the holes, however, even as new ones are discovered by spy agencies.The more serious near-term effect could be on the reputation of the CIA and the relationship between the technology industry and the intelligence community.Denelle Dixon, chief legal and business officer at Mozilla, which makes the Firefox web browser and was mentioned in the WikiLeaks trove, said that if the reports were accurate, the CIA and WikiLeaks were undermining the security of the Internet.",international,USA,

NA,"The first avatar of the i10, one of the most popular of small vehicles from Korean car maker Hyundai, would have completed 10 years this October. It will now not happen. Hyundai, second biggest car maker in this country, has decided to stop producing the hatchback. The brand, however, survives in the Grand i10, launched as an upgraded replacement in September 2013. Since then, the company has sold almost 430,000 units of the Grand in India and exported 162,000. However, the Grand has a long way to go as it gets into the shoes of the i10. Hyundai's India operations have sold 1.69 million units of the i10 in domestic and export markets. Only a year after its launch, the i10 bagged the Indian Car of the Year Award in 2008 and since won several other accolades. When the Grand i10 was launched, it was supposed to replace the i10. Globally, the Grand is known as i10. However, the company decided to continue producing the i10 in India as there was demand and named the upgraded variant as Grand i10. However, volumes have been slipping in recent months. In the first 10 months of FY17, Hyundai sold 14,389 units of the i10, 38 per cent less than in the corresponding period of FY16. The Grand posted a significantly higher number, of 120,821 units, growing 12 per cent from the first 10 months of FY16. Today, the Grand is the most sold brand of Hyundai in India, accounting for 28 per cent of sales. Last month, the company launched a refreshed variant of the Grand, with better fuel efficiency, exterior styling and infotainment features.Hyundai's current position and popularity in the Indian market, where it now holds 17 per cent share, owes a lot to the i10 brand. In FY10, volumes of i10 in the domestic market surpassed that of the Santro, its earlier popular model, and it emerged as the largest selling model that year. Backed by Hyundai's strong sales and service network, the i10 was among the most sold entry-level hatchbacks, competing with the WagonR (Maruti Suzuki), Brio (Honda) and Figo (Ford).",business,,
NA,"With Carlos Ghosn, the chief at Renault-Nissan taking comfort from the sight of profitability in Renault's India operations, a lot is riding on Kwid, the company's best seller in India. The fifteen-month old SUV styled entry segment car though has seen some weakness in volume recently. Having sold more than 140,000 units of the Kwid, Renault today launched a new variant under the Kwid. The Kwid Climber will be available at a price of Rs 4.3 lakh and Rs 4.6 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi). The car, which is priced significantly higher than the entry level Kwid (Rs 2.64 lakh) is being targeted at the young achievers. ""This vehicle offers a lot of style quotient. The customer today seeks trendier and energetic products. It is a perfect semblance of style and premiumness,"" said Sumit Sawhney, chief executive officer and managing director at Renault India. Kwid's early success is evident from a number of 50,000 in booking in just about a month of launch in September 2015. The company announced in March 2016 that bookings hit another milestone of 100,000 units. Yet another milestone of 150,000 bookings was made public in July 2016. When Renault expanded the Kwid range with launch of 1 litre engine in August last year, it said cumulative booking Kwid stood at 165,000 vehicles. Sawhney declined to share the cumulative bookings for Kwid. He also said the monthly booking details could not be shared. Kwid competes with the country's most sold car, the Alto (Maruti Suzuki), the Eon (Hyundai) and the Tiago (Tata Motors). Volumes sold by the company hit an eight-month low of 6,900 in January. After hitting a high of about 10,000 units around August-September, the number looks under pressure since November. The company said February was better at 9,600 units. ""Our aim is to sell 8,000-10,000 units of the Kwid every month,"" said Sawhney. Kwid's significance is evident from the fact that it brings over 80 per cent of the volume Renault sells in the country, now its eighth biggest market. The French car maker now commands about 4.5 per cent market in India. The cumulative sales of Kwid has allowed the company to negotiate for supply of components from vendors at a lower price, thereby aiding profitability. Even while he is reluctant to talk about latest bookings, Sawhney believes there is much steam left in the Kwid. ""This car has a potential to sell more. I will not put a number to where it can move up,"" he added. Renault has scaled its sales network by adding 65 points in 2016 calendar year. Another 50 outlets will be added in 2017, taking the number to 320.",business,,
NA,"A division bench of the Delhi High Court on Thursday upheld a single judge order restraining Cipla from selling its respiratory disease drug - Indaflo.  Cipla had launched the drug in the Indian market in 2014 under the name Unibrez, while also calling for the revocation of five Novartis patents on Indacaterol, the generic version of the respiratory medicine. Cipla later had to change the name Unibrez to Indaflo, after a court order held the earlier name as infringing on the trademark of Novartis's own variant - Onbrez. After winning the first round in court, Novartis filed a separate suit for permanent injunction claiming the infringement of its patent on Indacaterol by Cipla. Novartis's bid to stop Cipla from selling Indacaterol in its entirety became a reality after a single judge bench in January 2015, restrained Cipla from selling their version of the drug, until otherwise allowed a compulsory license to sell the medicine from a competent authority.  Following this order, both companies filed cross appeals before a division bench of the Delhi High Court.  Cipla lawyers Abhishek Singhvi and Pratibha Singh had argued that Novartis ought to grant a license for making the product to ensure its sufficient availability in India at an affordable price. Cipla had priced Indaflo, its version of the drug, at Rs 130 per pack of ten tablets, compared with Rs 677 for Onbrez. The counsels had also highlighted that Novartis imported the drug, which they claimed made it unaffordable to local patients and violated one of the key grounds to keep a drug's patents valid. Rejecting these contentions, and others pleas on grounds of public interest, Justice Badar Durrez Ahmed and Sanjeev Sachdeva sided with Novartis while pronouncing Thursday's judgment. ""No interference with the impugned order is merited. The appeal is dismissed,"" said Justice Ahmed while pronouncing the order in open court.

This, Jatia says, will happen over the next three to four years as the company gears up for the future.""What we are staring at is the interplay of technology and fast-food. The format that we have in place is innovative and intended to make the experience of being at a McDonald's restaurant pleasurable. The consumer can also end up doing a number of things, such as ordering from the kiosk or ordering via the app on his or her phone, so that he or she can save time. For those who can't make it to the restaurant, our delivery model is anyway in place to take orders,"" Jatia says.These next-generation restaurants will cost Westlife money, with the investment per store expected to shoot up almost 10-15 per cent. Currently, Westlife ends up spending Rs 2.5-2.7 crore for setting up a regular restaurant. While Jatia declined to indicate the precise increase in revenue at these next-gen stores, he did say that the revenue growth would be enough to offset the cost comfortably. Analysts, however, estimate the increase in revenue could be at least 15-20 per cent higher than the revenue from regular stores.Westlife has also padded up the McDonald's menu, introducing soups and salads, which analysts are interpreting as a bid to beef up its healthy offerings during lunch. In January, McDonald's had revamped its breakfast menu, giving it both an Indian and healthy twist. To be sure, McDonald's has been playing the health card for a few years now as Indian consumers increasingly become conscious of their well-being. ""Since June 2013, McDonald's has reduced sodium across its sauces and buns by 10 per cent and fries by 20 per cent. So far, we've taken 18,000 kg of salt off our menu,"" Jatia had said in an earlier conversation. The brand had also reduced the oil content in mayonnaise, bringing it down to a quarter from 67 per cent before, he said.",business,,

http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-mystery-of-police-reform/article17431239.ece,"Police reforms are going on and on. Nobody listens to our orders.    This is how a Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice J.S. Khehar reacted last week, while declining the plea of a lawyer demanding immediate action to usher in major police reforms in the country. The lawyer had earlier been permitted to implead himself in a pending PIL on the subject.It is sad that the highest court of the land is so helpless in the matter. Its anguish, however desperate and well-meaning it may have been, is understandable. It epitomises the pathetic state of affairs in public administration in the country, and it can only embolden our political heavyweights to brazenly halt the few contemplated reforms.While the National Police Commission (1977-79), set up by the Janata government that displaced the Congress government led by Indira Gandhi, kick-started reforms, the credit for keeping the debate alive and taking it to the highest judicial forum goes to a colleague of mine, Prakash Singh, former Director General of Police (DGP) of Uttar Pradesh and a former Border Security Force chief, who filed a PIL in 1996 and sought major changes to the police structure. His accent was on autonomy and more space for police professionalism by giving a fixed tenure for police officers in crucial positions beginning with the DGPs in the States.Long road to reformThe apex court gave its nearly revolutionary directions in 2006, a decade after Mr. Singh first filed his petition. While it is easy to blame the court for such an inordinate delay, one must remember that    police    being a State subject under the Constitution, the process of consultation was tortuous and time-consuming.The SC   s directions to the States included a fixed tenure of two years for top police officers in crucial positions, setting up of a State Security Commission (in which the leader of the Opposition party also had a role, and would give policy directions to the police), the clear separation of law and order and crime functions of the police and creation of a Police Establishment Board to regulate police placements. It also mandated a new Police Act on the basis of a model Act prepared by the Union government and circulated to the States. Policemen across the country were excited over this development and believed that an end to gross political interference in police routine was in sight.Events since 2006 have been dismaying, with several State governments devising their own means to dilute     if not wholly sabotage     what the Supreme Court had laid down. Finding that the court had stepped in mainly because there was no law on the subject, many States brought in quick hotchpotch legislation to water down the essentials of the Supreme Court direction. On the face of it, the new Police Acts appeared to be fully compliant with the judicial prescription. In fact, they were a ruse to outwit the court, without demonstrating any irreverence or defiance. This is why we still see Directors and Inspectors-Generals (IGs) being handed out a two-year tenure on paper, but given marching orders midway into their tenure on the most untenable and imaginary grounds. Nobody has protested.A few States have made officers temporarily in charge of the post of DGP without having to obey the SC direction. Commissioners of Police and IGs (Intelligence) have also suffered the same fate. The objectives of the Police Establishment Board, conceived only to depoliticise appointments and transfers, have been set at naught by the DGPs getting informal prior political approval from the Chief Minister/Home Minister with a view to placing politically amenable officers in vital places in the police hierarchy.Dispassionate observers have other ideas on the matter. In their view, mere autonomy to the police and job security, without upgrading the quality of recruits and ensuring dedication and honesty in the day-to-day delivery of service to the public, will be of little avail. They also dispute the popular theory that all police ills are traceable only to political interference in police routine. I am inclined to agree with this somewhat unpopular stand.Politicians as scapegoatsMany dishonest policemen     there are quite a few in every State police     get away with accusing the local politician of preventing them from discharging their duties. The pathetic state of police stations and their culpable tardiness in responding to the common man, crying for protection from a bully, are too well known to be chronicled. Policemen either ignore complaints, or when they do take cognisance of them, side with the aggressors. We are familiar with the spectacle of perpetrators of violence being treated as witnesses, and victims of crime converted to be accused. There is not always a politician energising the police to act blatantly against canons of ethics.I recently took up the cause of a junior worker in the IT industry, who was beaten black and blue by a few policemen on duty in a public resort for absolutely no fault of his. He was further deprived of a gold chain he was wearing at the time of the outrage. I took up the matter with the District Superintendent who, in turn, directed a young IPS officer to inquire into the unconscionable conduct of the police. Several months have passed by with no relief for the victim. In a more recent instance, the plea from a senior IAS officer, who retired as secretary to the Government of India, for additional traffic lights and related restructuring of vehicular flow at a busy junction, which had caused accidents, remains unanswered. Despite my taking up the matter purely in the public interest, there has not even been an acknowledgement of the request.Such callousness towards the common man   s simple, legitimate and uncomplicated requests, be it the rich or poor who go to the police on a grievance, is far too common. The excuse of preoccupation with law and order problems and inadequate manpower cannot fully explain the predilection for inaction that has become routine in our style of policing. Can you cite political interference or lack of resources as the alibi for this gross apathy? This is why the debate on police reforms sounds irrelevant and unappealing to the average citizen.Scope for improvementIs there hope of a measurable improvement in the quality of policing? I would like to say    yes   , but I am reluctant, because sections of the police leadership are not contributing enough to the cause of consumer-sensitive policing. They are either selfish or dishonest, or indifferent.It is equally true that many young IPS officers lose their idealism early in their careers, because of fear of vengeful politicians or disloyal subordinates. They, therefore, become deadwood, which the force cannot get rid of without prolonged litigation. The fears of proactive and dedicated officers about reprisal over honest action against powerful men in society and politics are well-known.But how long will the citizen be satisfied with a non-performing police force? This is the question we should ask ourselves while discussing police reforms. It is not as if this is a problem that has suddenly come upon the police. It has only ballooned in recent times because of growing lawlessness promoted by big money and all that goes with it. Unless there is self-correction within the police, a process initiated by the DGP and his aides, we cannot see a perceptible change in the manner in which policing is carried out in most parts of the country. Just as there are many bright spots in the police forces, there are an equal number of enlightened elements in our polity, who are willing to listen to police woes. There is here a symbiotic relationship without activating which our police forces will remain condemned and shunned by the law-abiding citizen.R.K. Raghavan is a former CBI director",other,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/guns-and-guards-a-lonely-vigil/article17431242.ece,"Killing for Conservation   , a recent documentary film on the Kaziranga National Park in Assam by the BBC, has seen the government serving a showcause notice to the BBC and suspending their filming in tiger reserves for five years.In the documentary, the BBC asserts Kaziranga holds a    dark secret   , that forest guards and staff are    given extraordinary powers   , they learn    ruthless patrolling strategies    and    ambush        in short, that people are being killed for the conservation of the highly poached flagship species, the Indian one-horned rhino. The documentary alleges there is a    shoot at sight    order in Kaziranga, due to which a host of people have been shot dead by forest guards.At the heart of the matter is the issue of conservation through guns     and forest guards holding those guns.Guns and guardsThe first thing to be clarified is that unlike what the documentary claims, there is no    shoot at sight    policy in any Indian tiger reserve. The park has a policy of giving limited immunity to guards     the idea is that they should be able to defend themselves in Kaziranga while carrying out their duties.That is the limit of the    extraordinary powers   . Armed poaching is a constant in Kaziranga, and despite systematic effort and patrolling, poachers still manage to kill rhinos and shoot at forest guards. To reduce the issue of Kaziranga to shooting     or to depict the forest guard as a trigger-happy Rambo as the BBC has done     is to do disservice to the issue.The difficulties and disempowerment forest guards experience need to be factored into the analysis of an extraordinary situation like Kaziranga, which sees rhinos shot nearly every month (18 were poached last year). Forest guards douse forest fires, often without protection, respond to human-wildlife conflict, walk beats which are bigger than that of a policeman, check illegal mining, combat flooding, plant trees, and deal with poachers who use arms rather than snares.In Kaziranga, forest guards also face guns apart from these other duties. This does not justify killings. But it begs the question of how much the state is willing to do for them. It would be unfashionable, but not inaccurate, to say that difficulties may be leading forest guards to shoot; this is possibly because of defence rather than indoctrination.   Killing for Conservation    also says villagers, not poachers, have been killed for conservation. It asserts that people have been shot during eviction drives from the national park. Last year, two villagers were killed in an eviction drive. Crucially, these shots were fired by policemen. While they were done for the purpose of securing habitat, the method was not prescribed by conservation. Policemen shooting at unarmed protesters tragically occurs throughout the country, it is not dictated by conservation or specifically by the    Kaziranga model of conservation   .The real issue still burnsIf we are to start solving some of conservations problems, we must stop reducing them to just gun battles. The state of stress in Kaziranga is different from that of other reserves, but sadly the problems faced by the forest guards are the same.Many personnel in uniform     policemen, paramilitary forces, army men     have a tough time, and may be feeling demotivated or isolated. But the forest guard stands out in that his or her work is far from the public or societal gaze     or acceptance. There are barely any witnesses to forest fires being put out, or averting the illegal killing of an animal. In the case of policemen or army men,    supreme    sacrifices are depicted in an institutionalised manner, and through a consumable ceremony     a bust, a medal, a commemoration, a plaque     all state-sponsored.Very few legends are created for forest guards. Protected areas are low on state priorities     and most tiger reserves run for all purposes on centrally sponsored funding. The levels of demoralisation in forest staff     even upwards of forest guards     are very high, compounded by the poor infrastructure they inherit.In February this year, 28-year-old Murigeppa Tammangol was fighting a fire in Bandipur National Park. Forest guard Murigeppa died while trying to douse the flames. He didn   t appear to have equipment     he was reportedly stomping out the fire. Three of his colleagues were injured.The forest guard needs support. He or she needs guns, but also an institutional mechanism that will empower her more than a token arm. As it is wrong to judge Kaziranga   s conservation efforts only on the numbers of rounds fired, it would also be wrong to imagine just a gun empowers a forest guard.Neha Sinha is with the Bombay Natural History Society.

Pictures show voters in Azamgarh, Firozabad and Muzaffarnagar.PTI, AFPPTITravelling back from Mirzapur, we work our way through Marihan Assembly constituency at dusk. There aren   t any villages for miles; the landscape here is dry and rocky, and spectacularly beautiful. We chance upon a stand-alone granary and meet a young man from the Kurmi community. The young man explains,    I have always voted for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), but this time I will vote for the Samajwadi Party (SP)-Congress alliance. Akhilesh Yadav has done exemplary work and deserves another chance. The candidate here, from the Congress, responds to his constituents    problems immediately.   The Kurmis are the numerically dominant community here. The BJP and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) have both given tickets to members of the Kurmi community, while the Congress candidate is a Brahmin. Yet, we hear many Kurmis will vote for the Congress this time. Earlier in Marihan, we talk to a farmer, from the Other Backward Class (OBC) Maurya community harvesting, matar (peas).   None of that caste stuff works here in Marihan. Look, I don   t like any of the parties, but I will vote for Congress because the incumbent candidate has been very effective,    he tells us. We ask him why the recent selection of Maurya leader Keshav Prasad Maurya as the State president of the BJP hasn   t made him a BJP supporter. He seems annoyed at the question, replying,    And if the BJP decides to drop Mr. Maurya tomorrow? What the heck are we supposed to do?   There is an undercurrent of frustration here with the way most journalists and academics characterise the politics of Uttar Pradesh as driven by blind allegiance to caste and religion. There are perfectly legitimate rationales for identity-based voting, from dignity, to social justice, to economic benefit, but none of that nuance really ever makes it into the popular coverage of U.P.There is also a lot more than caste or religion that enters into an individual   s vote choice calculation, such as candidate quality and the ability to deliver economic benefits. To reduce this complex choice to uncritical identity-based decision-making is disrespectful to the voters of U.P.The case for SP-Congress allianceThe decision of whom to support on voting day is extraordinarily complex. It involves strategic calculation (as we chronicled in our article,    Waiting for the silent voters of Uttar Pradesh to speak,    The Hindu , March 7) as to the competitive candidates/parties in the constituency, as well as beliefs about the candidate/party that is most able to deliver safety and benefits to the household, village, and constituency. The reality is that, for many voters, this is only a decision that is taken within the last 24 to 48 hours before voting day, as it is only in this period that much of this information can be ascertained.When political analysts are travelling around the State, often days before the vote, the voters tell us what they are supposed to say. When they are in the polling booth, however, they vote for the person or party whom they genuinely believe will do the best job.The secret ballot has a way empowering all individuals, even those who are highly vulnerable in daily life. It ensures that a voter can express her preferences without intimidation. The fundamental question is: what do voters think about the most just before they cast their votes?As we discussed in an earlier piece, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, from the SP, had attempted to build a larger electoral narrative around broad-based economic delivery, consistent with his own popular image, in a bid to sway a large swathe of voters. But this a narrative that was largely undercut in the first several phases of the U.P. election, as the SP party machinery is associated with the dominance of the Yadav community. But, as we move eastward in U.P., for the final few phases, frustrations with the Yadav community are less apparent, and the Mr. Yadav   s economic narrative seems to gain more traction. It is a convenient state of affairs for the SP-Congress alliance, where the broader narrative seems to be more effective precisely in areas where the core base of the SP is not numerically dominant.In Azamgarh, we speak to a rural schoolteacher from the upper-caste Thakur community. In a wide-ranging conversation, he details the successes of Mr. Yadav, stating,    I am a Thakur, and, like much of my caste, a traditional supporter of the BJP. But Akhilesh Yadav   s work cannot be overlooked. I am hopeful he will continue to do work in the future, and he deserves another chance. I will vote for the SP this time.    Azamgarh, which had been viewed as an SP stronghold for some time, is getting an unexpected challenge from the BSP due to frustrations with the family feud within the SP and the induction of locally popular Mukhtar Ansari into the BSP. If the SP is able to pull off victories in places such as Azamgarh, it will be due to its renewed ability to attract unlikely supporters like the Thakur schoolteacher.One of the extraordinary features of talking to voters across U.P. is the difference between how they view themselves and those around them. Voters would typically offer a nuanced explanation for their own (likely) vote choice and indecision among members of their own caste or religious community. But these same voters would often attribute hollow identity-based motivations for the vote choice of those in other communities.Uncertainty in the resultsYet, the motivations of voters can only be understood by paying attention to the nuances. Voters often expressed that both the BJP and BSP selected candidates according to cynical identity-based calculations. Most voters, like the Thakur schoolteacher described, want to vote for a party or candidate that offers hope for the future. It remains to be seen whether Mr. Yadav   s broad-based appeal was able to achieve this objective.This is an extraordinarily difficult election to call, and we will make no prediction here. The exit polls will be out soon, and hopefully they will shed some light on the likely outcome. Our last few pieces have been geared towards making the case for each of the three major parties/alliance in this election, the BJP, the BSP, and SP-Congress alliance. In our personal discussions about how to analyse this election, we keep on coming back to the same character.A divided lotOutside Pratapgarh, the day before the vote, we meet an engaging young man from the Kurmi community in his early 20s. It is a village with a Kurmi neighbourhood and a Muslim neighbourhood, but the pradhan (village chief), a Muslim, is always comfortably elected because he does good work in all neighbourhoods. In this constituency, the BJP has allied with the Apna Dal, a party that caters to the interests of the Kurmi population. But the Kurmis are a divided lot, and many important local Kurmi leaders had initially refused to endorse Apna Dal   s candidate.The young man is a civil service aspirant and extraordinarily balanced and eloquent in his analysis, and he is proud of his Kurmi identity. Until recently, most of the Kurmis had thought to strategically vote for the BSP because the seat was viewed as a battle between the BSP and SP, and the young man praised former Chief Minister Mayawati for her performance on law and order. However, recently some important Kurmi leaders had finally endorsed the Apna Dal candidate, and many Kurmis would switch their vote to the Apna Dal-BJP candidate. In 2014, the young Kurmi man had been an enthusiastic supporter of Narendra Modi, but not any more. He tell us,    Mr. Modi only gives jobs to wealthy private people. Akhilesh Yadav is the only man who can create jobs for U.P.   His mind is swimming with strategic calculations, and the issues of identity, safety, and economy. Our young man is genuinely conflicted as to his vote choice. He will decide just before he goes to the polling booth.How did this young man vote? We will never ask, and we will never know. But when the results are announced on March 11, we will be thinking about the choices he made.Neelanjan Sircar, Bhanu Joshi and Ashish Ranjan are affiliated with the Centre for Policy Research in Delhi",other,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/dire-straits/article17431234.ece,"There is no certainty about the circumstances that led to the killing of a Tamil Nadu fisherman somewhere between the Indian and Sri Lankan coast on Monday night. There is no telling who pulled the trigger     whether it was the Sri Lankan Navy or some armed group. It is also not clear where the shooting took place, whether in Sri Lankan waters or elsewhere. Unmistakably though, this was a tragedy waiting to happen, the direct fallout of the long-standing dispute between Tamil Nadu and Sri Lankan Tamil fishermen over fishing rights in the Palk Bay. While the Sri Lankan Navy denies it had a hand in the killing, the shooting exposes the lack of progress in the implementation of the agreement between the two countries on preventing loss of life while managing the fishing dispute through official channels. Last year, the two countries agreed on establishing a Joint Working Group (JWG) on fisheries to help resolve the dispute. A hotline between the Coast Guards of India and Sri Lanka, convening of the JWG once in three months, and meetings of the fisheries ministers every half-year were the components of the mechanism to be put in place. But short-term measures lose their efficacy in the absence of any forward movement toward long-term solutions. Without arriving at a settlement on sustainable exploitation of the marine resources that would end the use of bottom trawlers from Tamil Nadu, India and Sri Lanka will not be able to ensure incident-free fishing in the strait.Although instances of Indian fishermen crossing into Sri Lankan waters have always been commonplace, the consequences for such transgressions in recent years have been limited to seizure of boats and prolonged detention. Unlike during the period of Sri Lanka   s war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, when its Navy indiscriminately shot at boats and trawlers fearing smuggling of contraband by the Tamil rebels, the last few years have seen few instances of firing at fishermen. But to view Monday   s killing as an aberration is to underestimate the political and economic contours of the problem. After he returned to power in 2015, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Indian fishermen who crossed the maritime boundary to fish in another country   s territorial waters would be fired upon. Indian fishermen, who invoke traditional rights to justify their incursions, want a three-year phase-out period before they end trawling. But unless they take to deep- sea fishing, and inland alternatives, India   s fishermen will be locked in a conflict with their Sri Lankan counterparts as well as with a hostile Sri Lankan Navy.",other,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/staying-cool/article17431235.ece,"India has launched the second phase of the programme to eliminate the use of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC) as part of its commitment under the Montreal Protocol, which requires the complete removal of chemicals that result in ozone depletion and aid global warming. These are used mainly in the air-conditioning, refrigeration, polyurethane foam manufacturing and cold chain sectors, and must be replaced with better alternatives. All these sectors are in high growth mode as emerging economies witness greater urbanisation and higher agricultural productivity. The data for refrigerant consumption during 2015 compiled by the European Union show that in the developing world, split air-conditioning units, car ACs and commercial refrigeration record the highest use of these chemicals. It is imperative the Central government ensures that its efforts to upgrade industries using the $44.1 million in funding available under the Protocol are scaled up to meet the need fully. Modernising the technology used by 400 industrial units, many of them small and medium enterprises, by 2023 has to be complemented by policy changes that encourage adoption by consumers. Systemic change requires the active participation of State governments, which can enact and enforce new building codes and purchase regulations that are envisaged in the current phase. Newer refrigerants with lower global warming potential are available to industry, and there are some early adopters, while research on chemicals with greater energy reduction and very low contribution to global warming has to continue. Credentialed training of service technicians in the newer technologies is welcome as it will bring about change of refrigerants used in the repair and replacement market and create additional employment. It is important to make consumers aware of green options among products in terms of the underlying technologies, and incentivise adoption through tax structures.The Environment Ministry   s proposal to prescribe energy-efficient temperature limits for air-conditioning units in public facilities is promising. A lot of energy is wasted because of poor infrastructure and lack of understanding of efficiency metrics. Equally, the Centre should conduct audit of public buildings to determine whether they are suitably designed, as climate control relies as much on passive influences such as insulation, green roofing and the nature of materials used in construction. It is possible, for instance, to adopt the Paris idea and ask all major buildings to incorporate solar panel roofing or suitable green cover. The continued success of the Montreal Protocol in its goal to eliminate HCFCs by 2030 will depend on reducing the acquisition costs of cleaner technologies. The greater affordability of solar photovoltaic power and its rapid adoption at various scales is a clear pointer. More people will have access to air-conditioning and refrigeration in coming years, and the focus of government policy must be to make them energy-efficient and eco-friendly.",other,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-levelled-field/article17431244.ece,"Comparing sportsmen across generations is always a fraught exercise, yet it is tempting to wonder if the current crop of Indian batsmen measure up to their forebears from another millennium as far as one department of the game is concerned     the ability to tackle spin.There   s this apocryphal story of the legendary Pakistani leggie Abdul Qadir being particularly riled one hot midsummer day during a Test being played in the    80s. Reason? Sunil Gavaskar and Dilip Vengsarkar were at the crease, and every time Qadir would rip out his wrong    un, the batsman at the non-striking end would call it aloud for the other   s benefit even as the delivery had just left the fingers and commenced on its flight path.Death by dustBatting mainstays of the time raised the business of smothering the spin, playing with the turn or against it to an art. India   s successes abroad were too few and far between but its reputation as the last frontier for other cricketing nations to conquer was built on the edifice of preparing turners with the bench strength to exploit and negotiate them. From the 1-0 loss against Pakistan in 1986-87 to 1999-2000 when it lost both Tests against South Africa, India kept its series slate clean at home. And in three passages through this side of the subcontinent, Shane Warne, arguably the greatest spinner of all time, could only notch 34 scalps from nine Tests at an average of 43.11. This, when four Tests in Pakistan yielded a rich haul of 26 wickets.Cut to the latter half of the 2000s, and we have had to suffer the ignominy of horrors such as Jason Krejza, who would go on to play only one more Test in his career, finishing with match figures of 12-358 on debut for Australia at Nagpur in 2008. Four years later, the humiliation doubled as Monty Panesar and Graeme Swann spun England to a 2-1 series win.An inspired fightback at Bengaluru allowed the team to level the honours in the ongoing series against Australia, and it   s Advantage India as the action moves to Ranchi next. But as the likes of Stephen O   Keefe, who recorded the best match figures ever by a visiting spinner in India in the Pune Test, and Nathan Lyon, whose eight-for at Bengaluru is his third seven-plus haul against India and the best in an innings by any visiting bowler in India, slice through the Indian order with ease, it is evident that while increased exposure overseas has resulted in a greater felicity with the horizontal-bat shots, the art of presenting a dead bat is a dying one. It doesn   t take the eagle eye of Gavaskar or the wristiness of Mohammad Azharuddin and V.V.S. Laxman to negate spin. Asked once whether it was the tweaker   s fingers or the red cherry   s revolutions that he took cue from, the West Indian great Gary Sobers revealed an elaborate game plan:    I play the ball whichever way it goes after pitching.

NA,"At Taneira, traditional weaves meet modern designs and tell tales about the place of their birth Tata takes its first step into the world of handloom in a remodelled villa on 100 Feet Road in Indiranagar, Bengaluru. While there are dupattas, stoles, lehengas and yardage, the jewel in Taneira's crown is the sari - both the traditional nine-yard and the relatively newer six-yard drape.There are rooms dedicated to saris from different regions: Bengal's tant, kantha and jamdani in one; handwoven saris from Gujarat, Orissa and Varanasi in another; tussar and silks from Bhagalpur in Bihar occupy a third; and kanjeevarams, naturally, have an entire section. Design forward Designers work directly with weavers to create modern expressions of traditional weaves. ""We are trying to give weavers a better opportunity to retain their craftsmanship and keep their unique art form alive,"" says Ajoy H Chawla, Senior Vice President, Titan Limited. The design team is led by Anindita Sardar, an alumnus from NIFT. They travel to different parts of the country, choosing fabrics, motifs, colours and weaving patterns. Some of these weaving patterns, which have nearly died out, have been revived. So each sari has a story to tell, about the place it comes from or the life of its weaver. The patterns say it all: for instance, clay pots and earthen toys from Orissa are handwoven on a sari from the region. Read the little notes with delicate, hand-painted images that tell you about the sari you are buying. They make you feel like you are purchasing a small slice of the region along with the sari. Step by step While the price range starts from ?2,000 (cotton saris), look out for gems like the Patan Patola which, at ?2.5 lakh, can take up to eight months to produce. Each yarn is individually tied and dyed in several colours and this process continues till the required colours are in the picture, a process that takes one or two months. The yarns are then twisted together to form the warp and weft. The weft needs to sync with the warp for the required pattern to emerge, and this is one weaver's job! As for the Benarasi saris, Taneira houses one which has a shloka from the Ramayana woven repeatedly into it, across six yards. There is another sari with Kabir ke Dohe, while the Ganga ghat sari features the beautiful ghats (this one takes the weaver roughly four to five months). ""The brand is a testimony to the woman who wears a sari out of choice and not necessity and feels a complete transformation when she drapes it,"" says Shyamala Ramanan, Business Head of Titan Limited. Taneira is currently in a pilot phase where the focus is on understanding how the business model works and the response from customers. Chawla adds, ""We want to understand our audience better and fill the missing elements in their wardrobe. When they stand out in a crowd, so will we."" As for expansion, the brand has plans for about three stores in different regions, as well as exhibitions.",other,,
NA,"Or the mild melancholy you feel when you wake up after a nap The Space between You and Me is not just an installation. It is a basil-infused perfume inspired by an installation created by late artist Hema Upadhyay. Upadhyay had planted seeds on freshly-tilled ground, spelling out a letter to her mother that came alive as the seeds germinated and grew into a 'letter-garden'. Aphtoori is a fragrance based on a Ladakhi proverb that says 'On a spring day there are three colds and three warmths'. ""Smells and I, we talk,"" says Jahnvi Dameron Nandan, as we walk through the crowds in Jaipur one recent winter afternoon. Dressed in a lambent blue skirt, headscarf, and flat round sunglasses, she attracts considerable attention on the street. ""The scents come into my head at strange moments. In my fragrance Aphtoori, I have used grapefruit. I could listen to the grapefruit while blending it. I could hear it talk. I knew by intuition, knowledge and desire that it would go well with vetiver, the essential oil from the roots of khus-khus. You take time off from work and have conversations with mundane things around you. Fruits, cooking, tea, coffee, blankets, leather and the smell of babies. Inspiration could be anywhere."" Nosing around Jahnvi is a perfumer with an unusual story. Born in Lucknow, she spent most of her youth in Japan getting a doctorate in architecture from the University of Tsukuba, and then pursued product designing. After a few years spent between Mumbai and Sri Lanka, she moved to Versailles in France to study in a perfume school. Versailles houses a utopian hamlet commissioned by the extravagant French queen Marie Antoinette, complete with lakes, gardens, cottages, and watermills detailed with delicate spiral staircases and fine wrought-iron work, details that only a rich queen could afford. ""I know where you are going with the Marie Antoinette analogy,"" Jahnvi laughs. ""But believe me, perfume is more than just luxury. Luxury is a surface pleasure and barely reaches your soul. Smells do more. They send strong messages, create moments, memories. In the market, perfume may be luxury, but for me it is a work of art."" It's another day and we are sitting in rattan chairs under hanging paper lanterns shining on tea-crate tables and hand-sewn cushions at Dolly's Tea House in Kolkata. It's a hot afternoon, and Jahnvi has just done preparing for the launch of a new perfume. A lady in a starched white saree brings us cool glasses of ginger lemon tea, while Dolly Roy, the owner, who is also India's first woman tea-taster, gloomily fans herself, yawning after her noon nap in the chair. ""I have a perfume for her that I crafted a while ago,"" Jahnvi says. ""It's called Nezame. It comes from the Japanese word for the melancholy you feel when you wake up after a nap,"" she smiles, and continues. ""My grandmother always told me to practise my Bharatnatyam after my nap. This perfume works like that dance workout."" Goat's urine? Jahnvi attributes her sense of scent to her Lucknow genes. But perfumery is very secretive, she says. ""Even though I educate myself from ancient texts such as Gandhasaar, Ni'matnama or The Scented Garden, I do not understand their compositions. As a dancer, you can recreate compositions, but as perfumer I cannot do that.""Can she explain how a Ladakhi proverb can inspire a fragrance? ""I have always been intrigued by the line. Ladakhis have faith in saying that misery and happiness balance out in life, and that's what I wanted to create. And while perfume might smell beautiful, it isn't composed of only beautiful things-it's a combination of contrasting smells: some good, some terrible."" For instance, Jasmine sambac, a special Tamil Nadu variety that Jahnvi uses in Aphtoori, is full of phytochemicals that smell animalic, an olfactory term use to describe animal-like smells. Describing smells as 'butterscotch' or 'marmalade' is just a language of connoisseurship and sophistication. The typical olfactory grammar, especially according to South Asian texts, to describe some smells could be fish, goat's urine, ghee or lotus. ""We still use those terms behind the scenes but that wouldn't be great marketing practice for natural perfumes,"" Jahnvi laughs. Jahnvi inhales the fumes from the tea before sipping it, and talks of her personal life. ""I have sacrificed my personal life to become a perfumer,"" she says. She describes perfumers as dancers, leading an extremely dedicated and a practice-oriented profession. ""To smell 100-200 smells a day and constantly analyse them-there is a very athletic element to it. You are knackered by the end of the day."" What does it mean? Analysing a smell? ""When I smell a rose, I analyse it into lemon, clove, geranium, litchis, artichoke, cheese, wood and so on. So you aren't just smelling it, you are constantly associating it to notes."" And, apparently, even for someone with her exceptional olfactory skills, there are good and bad times. ""It's quite a fleeting thing,"" she says, ""that time when you can actually understand smells. I smell almost too well around 3:00 a.m. These remain secret conversations between the smell and me."" ""I will now associate Kolkata with the smell of tea,"" Jahnvi smiles, as we walk out. And what about Paris where she lives? ""Freshly baked bread"" is her instant reply. Tokyo is castella pies and construction work, and Bombay is fish. What about Lucknow? ""It isn't ittars or kebabs. I was too young to appreciate those. It would probably be the smell of my sister's head when she was born. I was four then and was told that she is very close and important to me. That's my first smell memory. I hope I can bottle its warmth someday.

NA,"Experimenting with geometry, folk and temple, each of Raji Anand's collections resonates with a unique vibe Raji Anand remembers a night, a couple of years ago, when she'd spent hours delicately cling-wrapping large silver thread spirals and ropes, for a line of jewellery she had created for danseuse Anita Ratnam's troupe. ""It was a Mahashivratri performance and the dancers were going to paint their bodies blue! I had to protect the pieces, but also ensure no one could make out and the detailing showed on stage,"" laughs Anand, recollecting one of the many times she had to think fast on her feet. Innovation comes naturally to the city-based designer, who has convinced many a discerning client to put aside her diamond jewellery to buy, instead, her 'fashion' pieces that are crafted from the most unusual materials - from hardware pipes to reclaimed pieces (like a worn-out anklet) and temple jewellery. ""I believe no one should ever fade into the background. My jewellery is like me, something that must always stand out,"" she says. And Anand, with her pixie haircut, bright blue glasses and gypsy jewellery, is anything but a wallflower. Different strokes Having started her career in jewellery design quite by accident - a discarded rubber hose from a gas cylinder inspired her to make her first neck piece - she has come far in the last five years. Besides her eponymous line, she also creates distinct capsule collections for various outlets, including Mathangi Srinivasamurti's e-site, Weddings & Marigold, sari boutique Shilpi and online luxury sari store, Parisera. ""It's easy for a designer to become known for one signature look. I don't want to fall into that trap, so I constantly try different styles,"" she says. Her recent collections include temple jewellery motifs (her claim to fame), folk inspirations, and contemporary designs. ""At Parisera, one of the questions they frequently got asked was 'how do we wear Raji Anand's pieces?' So when they launched a pocket-friendly line of saris, I came up with lycra neck pieces that used old coins and gypsy beads, to go with them,"" she shares. At Shilpi, however, her accent is on smaller, more elegant pieces. ""Their saris are understated, so I've done contemporary designs, with clean lines and a folksy feel. You will find leaf-like patterns, geometrics, and even a neck piece that uses filigree wall pieces from Orissa."" With Srinivasamurti's e-store, she's gone back to her temple inspirations. ""Since people wear saris, lehengas and the like, I've created a festive line that uses velvets, alloyed chains and high-quality kemp. One of my favourite pieces is a hasli, a North Indian choker, that I made with a rakodi (a South Indian hair piece),"" she says. Collectors' piece Anand's love of travelling - instilled quite young, as an Army brat - brings her unlimited inspiration. She is like a magpie, picking up stones in Australia and beads in Rajasthan. ""I look for things that may not be prominent by themselves, but which I can make larger than life. Then, when I feel creatively inclined, I sit down with all my bits and bobs, and follow my instincts."" To see some of her recent creations, you can flip through Sunil Menon's Sahodaran calendar, Aqua 2017. It has necklaces made with Scottish plaid and temple jewellery, and Egyptian-inspired spirals adorning the well-built models.",other,,
NA,"Amit Aggarwal explains the methodology and intricacies of using knife pleating on modern outfits ""It takes a skilled karigar and a lot of patience to hand pleat a textile of varied nature and convert it into an outfit,"" says Amit Aggarwal, while explaining how he does knife pleating on garments. Describing it as a technique that can be used by any creative person, Amit says it totally depends on how someone executes the technique in their collection. ""I personally see this technique to take crazier forms that have not been explored before."" This innovative designer, who has a habit of creating trends, grabbed attention of fashionistas when he demonstrated his flair for this technique at the recent Lakme India Fashion Week. He showcased how the un-stitched sari can be modernised with structured silhouettes and the fluid nature of handwoven silk Chanderi and Ikat. Excerpts: What fascinated you to use knife pleating? We have been using pleating techniques since a long time now in our clothing. It depicts the uniformity and movement in our outfits. This time we played with this technique in various sizes and materials. What was the challenge this time round? We were using pleating with saris so it could come out looking very traditional. With the language being so Indian, we wanted to voice the collection with a contemporary styling thus you see pleating done at the sleeves and not use it in lengths in outfits. Knife pleating is a tedious time consuming process and involves lot of mathematics... This is a beautiful process and requires accurate calculations for it to fall well or create the right visual effect. We have also been incorporating heat pleating to fasten the process but many a time hand pleating is done if we want to achieve some variation in it. Explain the technique to create pleat on outfits? While draping, we were trying to utilise pleating in a way that adds movement in the garment by placing it at different sections of an outfit like the sleeves, the hem or the upper waist. Have you been inspired by Issey Miyake, who internationalised it in 1980s. He has definitely explored the technique to a level no one has and has inspired many creatives to take the craft of pleating further and I am no exception to that. A simple technique like that can change the dimension and functionality of an outfit in the most unbelievable ways. There has been quite a rise of knife pleating at the haute couture this season. I think its a classic and will keep coming back. Knife pleating allows garment to expand its shape when moving. Is this not old fashioned? I do not go by the idea of it being old fashioned. The expansion of a surface when in movement is one factor that got me interested in this particular technique. I believe in reinventing an age old process and how it can be introduced in an outfit made for the modern day woman.",other,,
NA,"Custom-made storage for all things precious If you're one of the 75 people in the world who dropped close to a million dollars for a Richard Mille RM 50-03 McLaren F1 watch, you may want a suitably impressive case in which to store your opulent horological gem. Forget foraging at Cartier, Asprey or Smythson. Instead, look closer home, to the Jaipur-based Trunks Company. I chanced upon their wares at a champagne-swilling polo match in Mumbai a few weeks ago, and was mesmerised by their amazing range of trunks and cases. Using the finest Indian and European materials to hand-craft everything from classic steamer trunks to those for watches and jewellery to bar needs, the brand fashions trunks for all sorts of pleasurable pursuits. I saw a gorgeous tan-coloured made-to-measure watch trunk with custom metal sentinels to hold watches upright, in interiors made of the finest suede and brass fittings, illuminated by LED. Paritosh Mehta, the 33-year-old co-founder of the company, was at the aforementioned polo match, and he told me trunks have long been a passion for him and his fellow founder, older brother Priyank. ""Why?"" I asked, ""Aren't trunks so last century?"" Not so, he countered. ""We channel the legacy of trunks to suit contemporary life."" Thinking of the countless pricey Tumis and BRICs stacked up in my closet, I asked him to elaborate. ""We once had a Sikh gentleman commission a trunk for his turbans,"" he offered. Okay, my interest was piqued. What else? Trunks for prized pistols and one for a 400-odd pen collection. Paritosh then pointed to a compact bar trunk equipped with Italian crystal glasses and a decanter that was on display. I was suddenly transported to an 'Out of Africa' moment, seeing myself in an Yves Saint Laurent 1970s belted khaki safari suit, hair blowing in the wind, with an elephant and giraffe for company as I sipped wine in the middle of the bush. And what if I needed music? Well, Trunks Company builds a high-quality music trunk kitted out with Bose or Bang & Olufsen speakers. My reverie was interrupted by my Pilates pal Lara Morakhia. ""What are you doing here?"" I asked, dazzled by her moon-sized solitaire earrings. ""I had commissioned a custom-made jewellery trunk from Trunks Company a few years ago and wanted to meet the makers,"" she replied. Intrigued, I pressed her for more. Lara told me she was tired of going to the bank locker and wanted to wear her jewellery frequently, and so had a five-foot inbuilt trunk wall unit installed at home. She promised to send me photos. What I later saw looked like a treasure chest worthy of any modern-day princess - a leather safe with a large industrial strength brass lock which opened to reveal 20-odd drawers in varying depths swathed in plush purple suede. With prices ranging from ?50,000 (for a small poker trunk) to ?18 lakhs (for a custom-made personalised trunk), the five-year-old brand has gained a following amongst erstwhile maharajas, Middle Eastern potentates, hedge funders, tech titans and other rich folk. These Indian-made trunks are shipped to 15 countries. Until last month, when Trunks Company opened a store at the Rambagh Palace, everyone wound their way through a nondescript industrial area in the heart of Jaipur to the company's atelier, to place their orders. Has Louis Vuitton met its Indian match in Trunks Company? It would appear so. Personally, I can't wait to get my hands on one of these beauties. The Mehta brothers are now looking to branch out to four-wheel suitcases too. Travelling will never be chicer.",other,,
NA,"Water is the most subsidised material supplied by the government. Yet we see water leaks almost everywhere. Architect Anand Prakash suggests remedies. Accidentally I discovered that a leaky tap wastes a tanker load of water a year. Knowing that the water supplied to our homes in Bengaluru is pumped 500 metres up from a reservoir 120 km away in Mysuru, seeing water go waste is criminal. Apparently, water is the most subsidised material supplied by the government and yet we see water leaks almost everywhere. Water can leak in almost every item of the supply system. Let's first inspect our own homes and discover the problems and remedies. First, if the underground sump overflows, we have to just have a ball valve in place that costs Rs. 300 to arrest it. The valve must be replaced every 5 years as a rule. If not, the water exits between the concrete slab and the tank wall. We cannot see the water going into the surrounding earth. The next is the Over Head Tank (OHT). We have seen that the pump is not turned off until the sound of the overflow becomes audible and persistent. By then, good quantity of purified, potable water is wasted. This phenomenon is daily in some houses and twice a day in most of the houses. We must only fit an Automatic Water Level Controller (cost Rs. 1,500) that stops and starts the pump when the water levels reach the lowest and highest level. The human intervention in switching the pump on-and-off is eliminated completely. Think of the days when you forgot to switch on the pump and, when you wanted water, there was no power. Avoid manual operation. Auto Level Controller will remedy both. Water leaks in almost all the fixtures. Some drip, others run. The leaky taps of wash basin, sink, bathroom, backyard, car portico, garden, shower unit etc., drip or ooze water like a thread. The shower head, dripping water, goes undetected as we exit the bathroom thinking that the water stored in the shower bell is dripping. The health faucet leak also goes unnoticed as the water runs down the hose pipe. Unnoticed The wet patch under the solar water heater caused due to water leak on the terrace, also goes unnoticed as we rarely go to the terrace. It will certainly not be seen in the rainy season. Pumps also leak water. It's funny that I once came across a thin gutter made under the pump to drain the leaking water instead of getting the pump repaired. Water oozing in the commode from the flush tank is a huge waste, says an expert. It runs like a film on the inner surface and is seldom noticed. It takes an expert to assess the waste as the leak is ignored as negligible.Water leaking in pipelines can be detected by wetness in the wall. However, the leaky pipes running below the ground will never be identified. Just install a plastic water pump costing Rs. 500 to the outlet of the overhead tank. If the meter runs when all the taps and outlets are closed, you can be sure that the underground pipe is leaking. It's amusing that this meter will also help us to know the leaks in the sump tank. If the quantity of water received from the Water Supply Department and the quantity of water that is used from the OHT are not matching, you can be sure that there is leak either in the sump or the line connecting the sump tank and the OHT. Attitude matters We also waste water when we use without care. The best example is the tap kept running when we shave, brush and wash our face. Fix a aerator accessory to the basin tap. It costs about Rs. 300. It has a shower-like discharge with a tiny knob hanging out of the tip of the tap. Touch it, the water stops; and touch it again, the water flows. There are many companies that manufacture such water saving accessories (available on e-commerce portals) that can fit your existing taps. They reduce the water consumption by 80% in most of the fixtures. Water saving ideas Fit shower aerator (Rs. 155) to basin and sink tap. Water comes out like threads, similar to water coming out of bath shower. The water dispensed is only 20% It save upto 8 liters of water per minute Fit on-off aerator to wash basin taps. The knob at the tip when touched will stop water flow. It is convenient to stop while brushing, shaving and washing the face. Wash fruits and vegetables in basins and re-use the water. Collect cold water coming out of the tap from the solar water heater and geyser that flows before the hot water arrives and use it to wash vessels. Avoid shower bath as the water used cannot be quantified. Bathe with bucket and mug.  Use the large and small tanks of a commode accordingly. Avoid hosing the garden. Use drip irrigation for plants and sprinkler for lawn. Water plants in the morning to avoid water getting evaporated after ground is heated. Unlike common perception, it doesn't cost much.  Wash pets in water tubs by dipping them in water and not under taps and hose pipes.",other,,
NA,"When we build with cultural sensibility, our buildings embody ecological sensitivity as well, by default. By Sathya Prakash Varanashi. It is surprising to realise how every one of us, in our own way, is directly or indirectly involved with getting buildings done during our lifetime. It is one activity that most of us cannot escape, which at macro scale may mean commissioning a project or at micro level, just advising a friend about a design option. In the implementation team we have innumerable architects, engineers, builders, consultants, suppliers, site team and such others, involved in the building construction industry. Our annual output in terms of built-up areas, spread across villages and all towns, is beyond calculation. It is equally surprising to realise how most of us do not think much before we act. Most of our design and construction are based on a routine practice, endlessly repeated with minor variations therein. Naturally, deep thinking on design parameters like culture and climate are a rarity, resulting in the same faceless buildings being erected across India. While we have large number of practising professionals, paradoxically we appear to have a small number of thinking professionals, which could be the reason behind many non-descript buildings. Pan-India perspective This is where thinking architects like A.G. Krishna Menon and K.T. Ravindran become important. Both have a pan-India perspective about how we are approaching designs today and the imminent need to be context specific in our design interventions. These two senior architects may not be listed as eco-architects of today, possibly ignored by the younger generation. However, through their selective designs, public talks, academic involvement, explorative seminars and freelance publications, they have inspired a large number of professionals, paving the way for thinking about architecture. Ravindran's emphasis on the vernacular and Menon's observations of the traditional settlements highlight the importance of culture-specific designs. Incidentally, when we build with cultural sensibility, our buildings embody ecological sensitivity as well, by default. These architects with their analytical mind will not summarily dismiss modern architecture, but would suggest ways to blend tradition with modernity. Modern designs can also have green sense, be local and be sustainable. To that end, one needs to study the design options, their implications and finally choose the most appropriate.Learning from history History is too often brushed aside as a matter of past, but architects like Menon and Ravindran, show how we can learn from history. After all, historic buildings have been green buildings not only in India, but everywhere. What we can learn from them and apply in designs today can make our future generations safer. This process of learning cannot be complete if we study buildings in isolation; we also need to look at how buildings come together creating urban design, heritage zones and religious cities. Such rich contexts have created a lifestyle which in turn has created the contexts. Thus by recreating each other, context and culture have stayed true to a region - its geology, geography, flora, fauna and climate. By their thought process, these architects have proved that to achieve a green future, we need to iteratively study all facets of house, neighbourhood, city, culture, climate and of course living itself. Many of their designs are based on theories and in turn, they have evolved theories based on designs. Where theory and design inform each other without contradicting positions, there we can find the path to eco-friendly possibilities.",other,,
NA,"Support services have become a major part of a mall's image, and play a vital role in attracting footfalls. In India, facilities such as parking, security and housekeeping have evolved over the years to provide world-class services to mall customers. In fact, it can be said that support services are the backbone for any shopping mall. Moreover, the growing popularity of e-tailing - a superlative experience and provision of outstanding facilities in malls, have given customers more reasons to visit, shop and use malls as social destinations. The expectations and aspirations of consumers have increased over the years. The differentiating factors for shopping malls today are integrated value-added services and facilities. The ambit of key support services has also expanded to include more facilities and services. Services which were considered value-adds few years back are now basic requirements which any mall should provide. These services include valet parking, pharmacies, clothes alteration and shoe repair, car wash, first aid, travel desks, rent-a-stroller facilities, baby feeding and changing rooms, privileged parking for women, wheelchair ramps and various forms of assistance for the differently-abled, digital mall directories, currency exchange, cab service on call, and concierge desks, among others. India vs. global standards Almost all grade A malls in India provide excellent support services and facilities for their visitors. Nevertheless, despite the massive progress seen so far in Indian malls, we have still to see the arrival of genuine international standards. In international malls, a variety of other support services such as lockers on rent, print and copy centres, tour buses, Metro ticket machines, coupon books, pet stations, prayer rooms, post boxes and security escort are provided to visitors. Some of these aspects are obviously dictated by the culture of a nation, while others have more to do with what other infrastructure and social facilities are available in a city. For instance, The Dubai Mall offers superlative services and facilities to its visitors. It is a mall of truly international standards that caters especially to tourists from around the world. From personal shopping experience to tour buses and mobile charging stations to metro ticket machines, it provides a genuinely bracing and superlatively convenient experience to shoppers and the tourists alike. Not surprisingly, it is one of the most visited shopping and leisure destinations in the world, attracting over 92 million visitors in 2015 alone. It is also home to one of the world's largest aquariums and aquatic zoos, and other attractions that make it immensely popular. Role of mall management Professional mall management is a critical component for the smooth functioning of a shopping mall, and we are seeing increasing adoption of such services by the mall developers. As the Indian retail real estate sector moves towards for greater sophistication and maturity, the demand for increasingly advanced and efficient mall management service providers will see a quantum forward leap. In today's dynamic market, it has now become imperative not only to manage shopping malls well but also keep the operational cost competitive for optimal net returns. Professional mall management ensures that all operational aspects of the shopping mall are taken care of in an integrated manner. Support services are required in every region and each city as they attract the consumers to the mall, and mall management has become an integral factor that decides how successful a mall is. Today, consumers need a reason to come to malls over and above shopping. They expect a high quality of services, comfort and hassle-free shopping. An efficient customer interfacing strategy adds to the image of the mall and leads to repeated visits.",other,,
NA,"Give your home the Midas touch with these tips. Teja Lele Desai All that glitters may not be gold, but we don't care. Be it the precious metal or golden replacements such as fabric, accessories or knick-knacks, Indians love gold. It's evident during festivals, weddings and special occasions. But why not make this rich colour a part of your home round the year? Gold, a yellow-orange colour blend, is the shade of achievement, accomplishment and triumph. Associated with abundance, prestige, success, extravagance, luxury and quality, the colour psychology of this stands for opulence, material wealth and surfeit. Gold and gold tones have been a mainstay in the design world for decades. Be it the ramp, graphic design, beauty or interior decor, gold is a sure-shot bet to give your home a regal look. Decor pieces in rich gold can be a part of a neutral colour scheme just as gorgeously as they enhance a vibrant setting. But how do you go for gold without going overboard? Rajiv Rajgopal, director, decorative paints, AkzoNobel India, feels it's not tough to work gold tones into a home's colour scheme. The trick is to explore the colour and go with what works best for your space. ""For a sophisticated touch, a gold wall will play off well against pastel pink accents. This colour combination creates an invigorating backdrop for a home with mostly white or neutral furniture,"" he says. He gives us three simple ways to incorporate gold at home: Begin with an accent wall The task of painting might sound like a lot of work, but if you're just looking to refresh your space, you don't need to paint the whole house. Just do up an accent wall. When we create a space that isn't colour balanced and it has too much of one colour - it can leave us feeling off-balanced. Try painting an accent wall with a lighter shade of gold. Gold complements pastel shades and wood, and works wonderfully with minimalist designs. Contrast with dark shades A dark colour might not be a popular choice but darker colours can make a room feel cosier and create a dramatic and intimate feeling. Use pops of gold in darker rooms and select a pale colour that nicely contrasts with the gold to steer the room away from being too drab and dreary. A playful touch Far from being a gaudy colour that only fits into opulent decor themes, gold can also be used as a fun accent in rooms. Gold breaks the monotony of the wallpaper and adds an unexpected, playful touch. It also superbly highlights an existing black lampshade, show pieces, or can help tone down high-contrast colours in the room such as yellow.",other,,
NA,"To be free and fair, markets need active oversight and when required, strict regulation. To the generation that carries memories of pre-Independence India, British presence was an accepted part of the political and cultural milieu. The British dominated the Indian armed forces, the police and the railways. Individuals vied to get jobs with British companies which were considered the gold standard in corporate employment. Names like Imperial Chemical Industries, Metal Box and Imperial Tobacco attracted the best among young Indian job seekers. British companies based in Kolkata (then called Calcutta) controlled the coal, tea and trading industries and those in Mumbai (formerly Bombay) controlled the textile, utility and railway industries. Foreign, yes, but the British were the ever-present source of power and influence in India. How did this small island nation of sea-farers become the world's most dominant power, subjugating and colonising areas all over the world in total disproportion to its size? Amitav Ghosh's trilogy - Sea of Poppies (2008), River of Smoke (2011), and Flood of Fire (2015) offers some clues and opens the doors to the rich history of the previous 200 years during which British power and influence were consolidated in India. Ghosh's narratives are characterised by truly compelling levels of complexity and depth of detail. The author describes village life in Bihar in the early nineteenth century where economic disparities, exacerbated by the pervasive influence of caste, undergirded social relationships. Insert the East India Company, encouraging local cultivation of opium in the poverty-stricken land to supply its processing factories for trade to China. And now you have a picture of dominance and exploitation driven by the imperatives of economic opportunism. The Company exploited local politics to suit its economic goals. To this end, it manipulated local rulers to permit its own laws and maintain its own judicial infrastructure - courts, police force and army - to enforce them. There were no indigenous forces strong enough to offer opposition. Enter Raja Neel Rattan Halder, the literate and well educated zamindar of Raskhali, who belonged to ""one of the oldest and most noted families of Bengal."" The author reveals in the appendix to the Sea of Poppies that his own grandmother was the zamindar's granddaughter in real life, which infuses a sense of personal history throughout the trilogy. The zamindar's father, profligate, irresponsible and unresponsive to the needs of his people - reminiscent of the noblemen in Satyajit Ray's movie Shatranj Ke Khiladi - had run up some huge debts. Through a judicial sleight of hand, Halder was found guilty of breach of contract in relation to these debts. All his property was seized, and he was summarily exiled for seven years to Mauritius. The author narrates the stories of at least seven individuals from seemingly divergent backgrounds, and skillfully braids their lives together in a set of surprising circumstances on board the prison ship, Ibis, in its ill-fated voyage to Mauritius. His research into a wide variety of topics, which taken individually seem disparate, but collectively lend a colorful mosaic feature to the narrative. These topics range from the esoteric, for example, naval architecture, to the mundane, for example, language - Bhojpuri, spoken by the villagers in Bihar, and Pidgin English, used among people of different geographical backgrounds in the nautical profession. Equally important, they give insights into the sanctimonious defense of free markets on which the English traders relied to justify their opium trade. Finally, they highlight the inherent weakness in the Indian polity that enabled the British to gain stronghold in the Indian subcontinent, which their co-victims, the Chinese attempted heroically, but unsuccessfully, to avoid. On 'Pidgin English' The crew of the Ibis consisted of Indians, Burmese, Malays, Chinese and other nationalities. Communication between members of this group and their white bosses was in a tongue commonly described as 'Pidgin English.' The author provides an extensive glossary to this linguistic mutation in an appendix to the Sea of Poppies. The nautical term for crew was lascar, the origins of which was drawn from ""Persian, Hindusthani and Portugese."" Among the lascars was a hierarchy, at the top of which was the serang or senior sailor. The author constructs this amusing conversation between a white crew member and a serang.",other,,
NA,"Once again Mr. Costner has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary. Aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences, of which there are very few I just did not care about any of the characters. Most of us have ghosts in the closet, and Costner's character are realized early on, and then forgotten until much later, by which time I did not care. The character we should really care about is a very cocky, overconfident Ashton Kutcher. The problem is he comes off as kid who thinks he's better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet. His only obstacle appears to be winning over Costner. Finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker, Costner tells us all about Kutcher's ghosts. We are told why Kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing. No magic here, it was all I could do to keep from turning it off an hour in.",other,,
NA,"This is a pale imitation of 'Officer and a Gentleman.' There is NO chemistry between Kutcher and the unknown woman who plays his love interest. The dialog is wooden, the situations hackneyed. It's too long and the climax is anti-climactic(!). I love the USCG, its men and women are fearless and tough. The action scenes are awesome, but this movie doesn't do much for recruiting, I fear. The script is formulaic, but confusing. Kutcher's character is trying to redeem himself for an accident that wasn't his fault? Costner's is raging against the dying of the light, but why? His 'conflict' with his wife is about as deep as a mud puddle. I saw this sneak preview for free and certainly felt I got my money's worth.",other,,
NA,"It seems ever since 1982, about every two or three years we get a movie that claims to be ""The Next Officer and a Gentleman."" There has yet to be one movie that has lived up to this claim and this movie is no different.<br /><br />We get the usual ripped off scenes from OAAG (""I want you DOR,"" the instructor gives the Richard Gere character his overdose of drills in hopes he'll quit, the Gere character comes back for the girl, the Gere character realizes the instructor is great, etc.) and this movie is as predictable as the sun rising in the East and is horribly miscast on top. Costner plays his usual ""wise teacher"" character, the only character he can play, and you really get a sense of his limited acting abilities here. Kutcher is terrible in the Richard Gere character, just miscast with acting skills barely a notch above Keanu Reeves.<br /><br />The main problem with this OAAG wannabe is the two main characters are so amazingly one-dimensional, you never care for either in the least and when Kutcher's character finally turns around (just like Gere did in OAAG) you just go ""so what? The movie leaves no plot point unturned and seems to never end as if to say ""oh wait, we forgot to close out the girlfriend story, or the what happens after he graduates story, or the other six plot points in the movie...""

NA,"'Bloody Birthday' is an odd and, at times, humorous low-budget horror flick along the lines of 'Mikey' or a less intelligent version of 'The Good Son'.<br /><br />Set in a small Californian town, three babies are born at the height of an eclipse, where planetary alignment means they are somehow born without emotions. Ten years later, our three little psychopaths take themselves on a killing spree, doing away with parents, siblings, teachers and anyone else who irritates them. Only one teenage girl knows the truth to be able to stop them. There is no explanation for why babies across the world born at the same time aren't equally as twisted but there you go!<br /><br />For a slasher film, it's very tame in terms of violence and gore, which I suppose highlights the problem of casting child characters as the killers as there is only so much you can expose the young actors to. Instead, it's amusing and a little disturbing seeing three ten-year-olds plotting murders and carrying out their plans using guns, knives and crossbows. The main reason why it doesn't descend into being totally ridiculous is because the child actors are very convincing in their roles with the way they slyly play the little innocents in front of undiscerning adults while showing their dark side to the girl who knows the truth.<br /><br />'Bloody Birthday' is rather mediocre as a horror flick, with few scares and little blood, but because it has the shock factor of having kids as the killers, it is a bit unique in that way. One to watch if there's nothing else on.",other,,

There was laughter in the theater at moments that were in no way supposed to be funny. <br /><br />Great premise but just badly written and doesn't hold together.

NA,"I don t get it! The teenage leads in ""Horror Star"" supposedly all are devoted horror fans, yet when their favorite idol (Conrad Radzoff) passes away, they dig up his corpse and do all sorts of disrespectful stuff with it, like disco-dancing it around the house and throw food leftovers at it. That doesn't sound like something real horror fans would do, now does it? I am a big horror fan and I immensely idolize departed icons like Vincent Price, Peter Cushing and Boris Karloff, but it would never come to my mind to ridicule their memory. No wonder Conrad comes back from the dead ? admittedly, after a seance ? to wipe them all off the face of the earth! Mr. Radzoff already wasn't known for his friendliness in life, since he occasionally killed the directors that disagreed with his visions, and even after his death he suffers from a tremendous ego. Even inside his tomb there are video messages to petrify possible visitors and the group of teenagers will vividly experience that he also enjoys the murdering business outside his film sets. ""Horror Star"" (a.k.a. ""Frightmare"" and ""Body Snatchers"") is a pretty lame 80's horror flick, but there are a handful of cheesy & gory highlights to enjoy. The film mainly suffers from its own stupid plot, since no one ? not even a film school student ? is stupid enough to steal a recently buried corpse and actually think he'll get away with it, and there are too many tedious moments to struggle through. Conrad video-speeches from beyond the grave are overly talkative and definitely undermine the tension, but on the other hand his killing methods are pleasingly inventive. One teenager enjoys the experience of getting cremated alive and another one (Jeffrey Combs in one of his first roles!) loses his head in a delightful decapitation sequence. In the absolute messiest sequence, a poor girl head is crushed by a coffin. Writer/director Norman Thaddeus Vane wanted to bring homage to vintage horror cinema and he obviously how to make film look sinister. The locations and scenery are great, but Vane lacked the necessary funds to provide his film with a proper continuity and editing-job. The acting performances are overall decent, with Ferdy Mayne (imitating Christopher Lee) and Jeffrey Combs delivering the most memorable roles. ""Horror Star"" can hardly be called a must-see or even a good film, but it's worth tracking down in case you're an admirer of enthusiastically made B-horror.",other,,
NA,"I saw this movie on VHS some time ago (27 Jan 2003), just because of the name of Paul Rudd on the cover. I liked his performance in The Object of My Affection' very much and I really expected a good work. However, I found this film a complete mess. The story has a very confused screenplay and the characters are not well developed. Further, the low-budget special effects do not help much. I do not know the previous generation of Gen-Y Cops, but this next generation is not good. I do not recall exactly why I gave this grade (and I do not intent to see this movie again), but my vote is four.

NA,"This movie is so dull I spent half of it on IMDb while it was open in another tab on Netflix trying to find out if anyone thought it was one of the more boring, ponderous, gimmicky films they've ever seen. A warning: I actually could not finish it, so these are my impressions up to minute 54.<br /><br />Keira Knightly gets loads of screen time. As others have mentioned, her mother penned the script (perhaps during some sort of drug-induced stupor wherein utter inanities and emotionless statements about emotions sounded like interesting dialogue) and it seems that the film is a showcase for Knightly. Oops! Although I agree she is lovely (with her teeth unexposed...her barred teeth cause me anxiety and fear) I found her reactions forced and poorly timed. As in, William or Dylan does something cute...pause...HAHAHA from K with dimples and a playful arm jab. Like a minute too late. What? And she cannot match Cillian Murphy's intensity. He somehow manages to really look at her and look as though he is fascinated by her and falling in love with her whereas she seems totally disconnected, almost like she is interacting with a mirror. That must be torture, acting opposite someone who isn't delivering the same level of energy as you. Know what else is torture? This movie.<br /><br />Knightly does look stunning during her cyclical ""I've got 1940s pin curls and a hot dress. Watch me sing!"" shots, but what's the point? Is she an altar or an actress? When she talks it's bizarre, ""Ooow, Mehster Deelan. Whur eer ya going?"" This makes me confused because the accent is so mixed up and unauthentic, yet so thick at times I have no idea what she's saying (or maybe fell asleep). If no one knows who Vera was or cares, or few do, was it so important to give her this supposed Welsh accent? It distracts from all the rest of the action (just kidding there).<br /><br />This movie seems like someone dreamed a movie, maybe after reading a little Dylan Thomas before bed. But instead of adapting to the waking world was like, ""Man, that dream was so interesting"" and tried to replicate it. Then someone else cautioned, ""Your script needs work. Nothing that happens furthers a story or creates necessity"" and the writer is all, ""But that's the way I dreamed it!"" It's like the rambling fantasy of a child, one of those wild and meandering yarns they spin to get your attention. And THEN William went to a war and then Vera had a baby and then some blond chick drank too much and there were so many airplanes and pin curls and everyone had ruby red lips and...<br /><br />As for the Dylan Thomas character (so bland that's all I can call him), why didn't he have any lines in this goofy biopic? All he does is drink beer and smoke cigarettes and roll around with Sienna Miller, who is so wild and artistic she'll do a cartwheel in public! Get outta here, you crazy poets! (I realize she is not a poet, but she and Thomas are like this one nauseating unit of crazy guys havin crazy times, like a lukewarm Sailor and Lula from Wild at Heart.) Someone asks in the message board if they should buy this film. I say do it. Leave it on your shelf and only utilize it as a weapon to narcotize children, the elderly, or lingering house guests.<br /><br />P.S. to Murphy's character...when someone asks if you were ""in the sh**"" you can say yes, because your war scenes appear to have been shot at a landfill.",other,,
NA,"As noted in other comments here, the camera-work is laughably bad. I am tempted to say that the director of photography is a 7-year-old, but that would be mean -- to 7-year-olds.<br /><br />Okay, but what about the subject? I was looking for some insight into the state of the wine industry worldwide, you know, Mondovino. What the film is about is a very narrow view of one intrigue in that world: the struggle between Mondavi and the French and Italian wineries that they would like to buy. There is no enlightening narration that would put the whole deal into context, so we are left with the selective process of the director and the interviews with the various characters in this little psychodrama. There's no shortage of despicable characters, or even despicable dogs, in sight. There is a shortage of evenhandedness, however. <br /><br />Is the director a Marxist? I wondered as I tried to maintain some semblance of focus as the camera dipped, swerved, zoomed in a chaotic flourish. Small grower in France: good. Huge grower in USA: very, very bad. Forget about the hundreds of small wineries throughout North America, Australia, and South America. There is a dead horse to beat here for over two hours.<br /><br />To learn about the intrigue more, you are better off reading about it elsewhere.

NA,"""Fool for Love"" is one of the several now forgotten films Robert Altman directed throughout the 1980s. This one, a screen adaptation of a Sam Shepard play that features Shepard in the lead role, just simply isn't very good. Altman made many not-very-good films over the course of his fascinating career, and many times the fault was his. But here I think the fault lies with Shepard for writing such a flimsy play. Altman's direction is assured, the performances are o.k. given what the actors have to work with, but this inconsequential screenplay goes nowhere, and takes its time getting there.<br /><br />Shepard is Eddie, a stuntman who has a love/hate relationship with May (Kim Basinger). The two fight endlessly over the course of an evening spent in some dusty motel in the middle of nowhere, while a mysterious man (Harry Dean Stanton) who may be either a figurative or literal father to both Eddie and May quietly observes. Randy Quaid rounds out the four-person cast as a gentleman caller.<br /><br />The only dramatic hook in the entire plot is the suggestion that Eddie's and May's relationship is incestuous. However, this hook feels more like a gimmick than anything. The screenplay doesn't explore their relationship in any detail, and it doesn't use their relationship to explore any more universal themes. Shepard and Basigner create eccentric, mannered characters who grow irritating within the first five minutes; Stanton and Quaid have little to do but provide reaction shots. <br /><br />The last half hour or so of the film is especially bad, when Eddie's and May's back stories begin to play out in flashback over monotone, somnolent voice over.<br /><br />Chalk this up to another of Altman's experiments gone awry.<br /><br />Grade: C-",other,,

http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/modis-up-wave-and-after/article17453714.ece,"Vidya SubrahmaniamThe following statistical nuggets should help to capture the superhuman size of Prime Minister Narendra Modi   s victory in Uttar Pradesh.In the 1984 Lok Sabha election, the Rajiv Gandhi-led Congress won 83 of 85 seats from U.P. for a phenomenal vote share of 51%. However, in the subsequent Assembly election to U.P., the Congress   s share of seats and votes dropped to 269 of 425 and 39.25%, respectively.In the 1991 Lok Sabha election, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), then riding the Ram temple wave, won 51 seats from U.P., polling 32.82%. The party continued its winning streak in the Lok Sabha, getting 52 seats for 33.44% in 1996 and 57 seats for 36.49% in 1998. The BJP   s victory run ended eight years later in 1999 when its share of seats and votes dropped to 29 and 27.64%, respectively.A mismatchYet it was a different picture in the Assembly elections. In the 1991 Assembly election, the BJP won 221 seats for a vote share of 31.45%. But this was a one-off performance. The BJP lost all five Assembly elections held between 1993 and 2012. Importantly, it lost the elections of 1993 and 1996 at a time when it held a majority of seats from the State in the Lok Sabha. The 1993 loss was particularly noteworthy because that election was held in the backdrop of the December 1992 destruction of the Babri Masjid, which was thought to have placed the Hindutva-inspired BJP in an unassailable position. Logic dictated that the BJP should have benefited from the post-Babri Masjid Hindu consolidation. However, the party was stopped in its tracks in the Assembly by the emergence of the identity-based Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP) as powerful regional players.What these figures establish is that in U.P, as perhaps elsewhere, there is often a mismatch between the Lok Sabha and Assembly election performances of parties primarily because the Assembly field gets queered     both by factors locally unique and relevant and by the stronger presence of regional actors.Rajiv Gandhi who was unstoppable in 1984 was forced to confront the Lok Dal, which had its own sphere of influence, in the 1985 Assembly election. The Lok Dal picked up 84 seats then. In fact, most psephologists treat a gap of five percentage points between the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections as a given for any party on the presumption of a preponderance of local factors in the latter.The Modi imprintThis long-held trend stands smashed with Mr. Modi   s staggering haul of 312 seats for a vote share of 39.7% in the 2017 Assembly election. How did this happen? The SP and the BSP, whose turn it was to stand up and fight, collapsed in the face of the Modi machine. A host of imponderables, among them local preferences, absence of a Chief Ministerial face, rebel contestants, not to mention the 100-odd dalbadlus (party hoppers) fielded by the BJP overlooking the claims of alienated veterans, all vaporised under the force and energy that Mr. Modi brought into the campaign. There was Mr. Modi and nothing beyond Mr. Modi. The Prime Minister made every calculation, every estimate, the wildest predictions irrelevant in a story where he played all the parts. On the campaign, the Congress vice-president, Rahul Gandhi, would joke that Mr. Modi was all about himself: in the film he produced he was hero, director, writer, photographer all rolled into one. Ironically, this came true but with a twist. The film Mr. Modi produced was so completely about himself that his own party became an extra in it while all Mr. Gandhi could manage was a place in the audience.A day after a verdict that is in itself a testament to Mr. Modi   s phenomenal popularity, any recollection of the popular mood might appear redundant. But the recapitulation is necessary if only to underscore the extraordinary nature of the Prime Minister   s relationship with U.P. voters. On a tour of the State, I met with people whose faith in Mr. Modi was so absolute that they parroted his every line with conviction, refusing to even consider the possibility that there might be exaggerations in his claims     whether made in the course of his    Mann ki Baat    radio broadcasts, during speeches delivered abroad and in India, or more recently while on the stump, almost all of it beamed live and therefore made that much more impactful. Mr. Modi   s address to the nation on demonetisation, watched and heard by millions of people, turned out to be history-altering. Mr. Modi   s casting of notebandi as a class war resonated so strongly with the poor that they became his captive vote bank overriding caste lines.Voices on the groundAt a grocery shop in Garhi Kanoura in Lucknow, owner Shashi Gupta lavished praise upon Mr. Modi, calling him     nek     (good),     saaf dil     (clean of heart) and     garibon ka masiha     (messiah of the poor). Notebandi expectedly topped her list of achievements by Mr. Modi, but a surprise inclusion was the 104 satellites sent up by ISRO. I tried to argue that the achievement was the cumulative result of years of hard work and research. But she was adamant. Mr. Modi had said he had done it, so he had done it. Even if it was a lie or an exaggeration, it didn   t matter.The Prime Minister might have become the butt of social media jokes for his frequent overseas visits. But for the faithful, the travels had raised the profile of the country and brought it     samman    (honour)     again a repeat of Mr. Modi   s own words without engagement with what these trips might have actually achieved. The country   s prestige figured frequently in conversations, and in some places, people simply said they liked everything about Mr. Modi. What was everything?    Everything.   The voices on the ground were too loud to miss. But who could have known that a Prime Minister would use the Lok Sabha format to steamroll all local variations and conflicts and wrest the biggest mandate since the Janata Party wave of 1977? That this happened breaking past trends is a warning sign for more than one reason. The faith Mr. Modi   s voters have placed in him would frighten anyone not as supremely self-confident as he is. Surrender on this scale can be both empowering and disempowering. It can nudge Mr. Modi, via the Chief Minister he appoints, towards speedy delivery of promises. But equally, any failure can breach the trust to devastating effect.A more worrying aspect, brushed over in the exclamations caused by the size of the verdict, is the communal grooming of the polity. Travelling in west U.P., I found perfectly sane discussions turn into hate talk and Muslim-bashing. At mid-point, Mr. Modi brought in references to kabristan and shamshan and his party chief, Amit Shah, denounced his opponents as    Kasab   , all of which became licence to shame communities, and in language unprintably coarse in some places. The Akhilesh Yadav government   s perceived partisanship towards Muslims and Yadavs was already an issue with voters who seized on the words of encouragement from Mr. Modi to openly air their prejudices.A group of schoolboys on the road from Allahabad to Varanasi said temples in their villages had been razed to build grand new mosques. A quick check revealed this to be a dangerous exaggeration. At a wayside teashop in Sursanda village in Barabanki district, Rajesh Yadav said he had voted the SP but mentioned Ram mandir as a top priority.    We are Hindustan, not Kabristan or Pakistan.   At the Allahabad High Court where I met 30-odd lawyers, there was near consensus on voting Mr. Modi. But almost immediately, the conversation degenerated into xenophobic excoriation of Muslims. A woman lawyer associated with the SP said that while she did not care for Mr. Modi, she liked him for not having fielded any Muslim on the 403 Assembly seats.When the winning party consciously excludes Muslims from its calculations, what message does that send? When voters approvingly quote that decision as the reason for Mr. Modi   s impending victory, what does it portend for India   s future? As Mr. Modi celebrates his victory, he should also reflect on the true essence of the BJP   s election slogan, sabka saath sabka vikas .vidya.s@thehindu.co.in",other,,

The charisma of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the political stratagem of Amit Shah have proved to be too good for the Bharatiya Janata Party   s political opponents to throw a spanner in the BJP   s unstoppable march as a true pan-India party. With some political observers describing the just-concluded elections in five States as the semi-finals round for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP is confident that the NDA will comfortably clinch the final too.Response from rivalsWhile the people once again displayed their wisdom and dismissed the opportunistic alliance of the Samajwadi Party and the Congress in U.P., and also voted in favour of the BJP in Uttarakhand, a similar kind of maturity and grace was lacking from the BJP   s political rivals. Instead of accepting the mandate for what it is, the leaders of some of the political parties mocked the people   s choice and charged the BJP with polarising the elections in U.P.

Can anything be more illogical or puerile?Apart from the Prime Minister   s magnetism, the dedication and hard work of the rank and file of the party and the numerous pro-poor, pro-farmer and pro-women schemes of the NDA government contributed to the BJP   s win.The spectacular performance of the BJP in the Hindi heartland against the backdrop of the game-changing decision to invalidate high-value currency is all the more sweet since many political and media pundits treated the elections as a referendum on demonetisation. The glee on the faces of the critics of demonetisation must be lost, as their assumption that it would spell disaster for the BJP has been proved wrong. Instead of     votebandi    , it was total and overwhelming support for the war against corruption and black money.Almost in every election from the Panchayat to the Lok Sabha after November 8, people have unambiguously endorsed demonetisation. Be it the by-elections to the Lok Sabha or Assemblies, or the series of municipal elections in Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh and Chandigarh, people have supported the BJP post-demonetisation.The mandate in U.P. clearly showed the mood of the nation     people preferred the leadership, credibility and experience of Prime Minister Modi to the unprincipled SP-Congress alliance and the inexperience of its leaders. The results reflect the endorsement of three MODIs     Mood of Developing India, Making of Developed India, and the leadership of Mr. Modi.Since 2014, the Prime Minister has changed the mindset of the people. They are now giving top priority to development and treating it as the new religion. Mr. Modi proved to be the greatest unifier of all sections in the country while exposing the real face of the pseudo-secularists.The groundswell of support to the BJP reflects the fact that several pro-poor schemes launched by the NDA government are yielding dividends at the grassroots level. Schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, under which LPG connections are given to BPL families, have made a huge impact in U.P. and elsewhere. Overall, 1,89,07,427 connections were given all over the country till March 10, 2017. Similarly, 6,53,32,419 loans were sanctioned under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, which provides micro credit of up to Rs. 10 lakh to small entrepreneurs.Support across sectionsWith a huge increase in the vote share of the BJP in U.P.     from 15% in 2012 to about 40% now     the results show that the Modi-led BJP has won the confidence of various sections, including the minorities, Dalits and backward classes across U.P. It is obvious that Muslims across U.P. also supported the BJP in good numbers, as no party has got such a huge majority in the State since 1980.The unprincipled SP-Congress alliance, the personal attacks on the Prime Minister by the BJP   s rivals, poor governance, lack of development, and the side-lining of SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav have apparently not gone down well with voters in U.P. The BJP juggernaut also decimated the Bahujan Samaj Party, which was a formidable force. The BSP   s caste and communal politics and its corrupt image cost the party dearly in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and again now.Anti-incumbency apparently played its part in Punjab. However, it was a remarkable performance by the BJP in Manipur where its vote share increased from 2.12% in 2012 to over 34% now. Similarly, in Uttarakhand, it went up from 33.13% in 2012 to over 45% now. The inroads made by the party in the Northeastern States     Assam earlier and now Manipur     is noteworthy.The Congress was so desperate in U.P. that it readily accepted the SP   s invitation to join hands after having declared Sheila Dikshit as the chief ministerial candidate. This kind of opportunism certainly did not go well with the people and added to the existential crisis that the Congress is facing. In fact, political observers are crediting the victory of the Congress in Punjab solely to the image of former Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and not to Rahul Gandhi. That in itself casts a long shadow on the future of the current Congress leadership and the policies it has pushed in recent years.Interestingly, the Aam Aadmi Party, which hoped to spread its wings, could not make significant inroads because of its cheap politics and lacklustre performance in Delhi.The splendid showing by the BJP is a huge endorsement of its development agenda and total negation of the obstructionist politics. The results have shown that BJP has established supremacy in around 60% of the constituencies that went to polls.A big message from this round of elections is that the BJP has emerged as a true national party of the common man, a huge shift from being viewed only as a nationalist party in the past.M.

http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-congresss-punjab-lifeline/article17453717.ece,"ashutosh kumarThe unprecedented victory in Punjab has come as a major morale booster for the Congress party, which has been struggling since its debacle in the 2014 general election followed by a series of defeats in the States where it once held power. Punjab may not be a large State in terms of the number of Lok Sabha constituencies, but as a borderland, Sikh majority State with a troubled past, it is much more important than the numbers speak.Looking at the massive victory of the Congress, it is quite clear that the party has not only been able to manage its traditional support base that comes from both Hindus and Sikhs but also from rural and urban Punjab across the three electoral regions. It also got the traditional Akali supporters    vote that was supposed to go to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) due to Operation Blue Star as well as the anti-Sikh riots, followed by widespread human rights violations targeting Sikh youth. The fact that the AAP failed to gain significant support in the southern Malwa region shows that the party has been unable to corner the anti-Akali vote as this belt has been buffeted by large-scale farmer indebtedness, cash crop failures and farmer suicides. The Akalis have lost their traditional voters due to the party being held responsible for taking away the autonomy of the sacred Akal Takht and politicising/manipulating the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee to further its political ends. The party   s failure to punish the culprits who desecrated the holy Guru Granth Sahib has been another reason. This was compounded by the party openly hobnobbing with the various Deras including the controversial Dera Sacha Sauda and seeking their support in search of the sizeable Dalit vote, a segment the party failed to accommodate in its power structure.Losing the plotThe Congress   s massive victory is also due to the failure of the AAP to cash on its impressive debut in 2014 when the party not only got 24% of the vote share but also led in 33 Assembly constituencies when it was not considered a party that could win. However, instead of presenting itself as a real alternative, AAP   s Delhi-based leadership allowed the dominance of the non-Punjabi leadership during the whole process of campaigning and also resorted to reckless expulsion of its Punjab State leaders and workers on flimsy charges. This not only demoralised the party workers but also disenchanted regionally rooted Punjabi voters. In the Congress   s Amarinder Singh, these voters looking for change saw not only the possibility of getting rid of the corrupt Akali government but also a sense of continuity in the form of a stable government led by a strong, experienced Punjabi leader with a relatively clean image. He had stood up to the Congress top leadership on regional issues such as the Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) Canal.The AAP also suffered in terms of resources as well as a lack of knowledge of the relevant social and economic determinants at the constituency/booth levels, which are important, as local issues and factors dominated the elections. It showed as the party focussed on as many as 69 seats in the Malwa region in the hope of a sweep and in the process ignored the other two electoral regions     25 seats in Majha and 23 seats in the Doaba regions. As the result shows, the party failed to sweep the Malwa region, winning only 18 seats, got only two seats from Doaba and no seat from Majha. Nevertheless, the AAP as the main Opposition party is a good omen for the beleaguered State fighting not only economic decline but also the drug menace and crime. The party has shown that it can effectively use social media and mobilise youth to pressure the Congress government to fulfil its poll promises and set right governance. The AAP effect was visible in the Congress   s manifesto and during the campaign.Ashutosh Kumar is Professor, Department of Political Science, Panjab University",other,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/futile-polls-fruitful-reportage/article17453720.ece,"A.S. PanneerselvanJournalists try to explain political dynamics during elections through electoral arithmetic and electoral chemistry. While they rely on a range of statistics for the former, they try to gauge the popular mood of the people through field reporting to discern the latter. However, over the last two decades, opinion polls seem to have replaced conventional journalistic wisdom. Media houses, especially television channels, began giving primacy to surveys     both pre-poll and post-poll     to capture the political trend.Relying on opinion polls to get an idea of which way the political wind is blowing has turned out to be a futile exercise since the    India Shining    campaign of the National Democratic Alliance in 2004. Barring exceptions, most polls have got their numbers wrong. The astounding victory crafted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah in Uttar Pradesh was not captured by any poll.Getting it wrongThe Indian media is not alone in this conundrum called opinion polls. Most polls in the U.K. did not predict the Brexit result and the American polls failed to predict Donald Trump   s victory. In India, recent examples have been the failure to predict the victory of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) in Tamil Nadu in 2016 and the victory of the grand alliance of the Janata Dal (United), the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Congress in Bihar in 2015. David Uberti of Columbia Journalism Review in an essay,    How polling data can be dangerous for political journalists   , explained the pitfalls in relying on opinion polls to gauge the political mood.I had a humbling experience with pre-election opinion polls in 1998. I was working for Outlook magazine and we commissioned AC Nielsen to do the survey. We predicted a landslide victory for the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Tamil Manila Congress front. Instead, the AIADMK-led front made a dramatic comeback. I had to write an article explaining our failure. Partha Rakshit, Managing Director of AC Nielsen, wrote a supplementary piece,    Hazards of Forecasting   , that talked about the problems in projections from the day on which the survey was conducted to the swing forward into voting day. I tend to agree with sociologist Herbert Gans:    Polls are not the best representative of the popular will, for people   s answers to pollster questions are not quite the same as their opinions     or, for that matter, public opinion.    The electoral outcome is an organic manifestation of the people   s will. An opinion poll is an inadequate tool to comprehend this democratic spirit.The Pew Research Center published an article,    Why 2016 election polls missed their mark   , listing three major factors: non-response bias, many of those who were polled were simply not honest about whom they intended to vote for, and the way pollsters identify likely voters. The Pew Research Center explains non-response bias:    It is possible that the frustration and anti-institutional feelings that drove the Trump campaign may also have aligned with an unwillingness to respond to polls.    The article concedes that identifying likely voters is    is a notoriously difficult task   .Many questionsThe problem with journalism, which is akin to the social sciences, is that it wants to mimic the fundamental sciences. Why should it strive for a number? Is it not enough if it explains the processes, the players and the different possible outcomes? What is the place for guesstimates that masquerade as scientific predictions in daily journalism? Some questions for which I have not got convincing answers are: Is there an ideal sample size? Is there a proven formula to convert the vote share to the number of seats? Is it possible to extrapolate the vote share pattern of one region to a larger unit, say, a State or the country?In this context, I am delighted with this newspaper   s decision to deploy its resources in extensive reportage and to not commission election surveys. Surveys have a speculative quality to them. Good reports, on the other hand, always capture a sliver of life.readerseditor@thehindu.co.in",other,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/first-among-unequals/article17453710.ece,"Five Assembly elections in five different States cannot possibly have one running national theme. But when one of them is in Uttar Pradesh, with the largest electorate in the country by far, the debate inevitably moves to the possible pointers for the 2019 Lok Sabha election. Even if the Bharatiya Janata Party   s victory in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand was expected, the more than three-fourths majority was a surprise to supporters and detractors alike. Nearly three years after the Lok Sabha election, nothing much seems to have changed on the electoral ground. The biggest takeaway is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains the pan-Indian face of the BJP, and the combination of the promise of economic development and the propagation of a muscular nationalism is hard to beat. Those who thought that Mr. Modi   s popularity had peaked in 2014 were probably right, but instead of a sharp decline from then on, his acceptance among voters seems to have reached a comfortable plateau.In both U.P. and Uttarakhand, the BJP   s vote share dipped only marginally, from 43.6% (together with smaller allies) in 2014 to 41.4% in the former, and from 55.9% to 46.5% in Uttarakhand. In the absence of a united opposition, as in Bihar in 2015, the elections in both States were a stroll in the park. Any gains the Samajwadi Party and the Congress made through an alliance were lost because of the infighting in the SP, and owing to a slightly improved performance by the Bahujan Samaj Party, which at 22.2% polled 2.4% more of the total votes in 2017 over 2014 despite finishing a poor third. The SP leader and outgoing Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav, did try to shed some of the anti-incumbency baggage by distancing himself from the old guard in the party, but in the process his party came across as a divided house. Voters quite rightly refused to buy into the narrative that the failures on the law and order front and the shortcomings in governance were entirely on account of an earlier generation of leaders. If he was attempting to appeal to the youth, projecting himself and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi as the face of the campaign, he did not quite succeed in it. A grand alliance of the kind that saw the BJP lose in Bihar would have had to include the BSP, unthinkable though it is given the caste dynamics at play. But BSP supremo Mayawati did herself no favours by continuing to be averse to a pre-poll tie-up, while displaying an unseemly readiness to align after the election without any ideological compunctions. The BSP, which has allied with the SP and the BJP at different points, needs to reconsider this strategy if it wants to expand beyond its core Dalit constituency. The party may not have held much appeal for minorities, despite fielding Muslims in about one-fourth of the total seats. In the present political climate, in the absence of a Bihar-type grand alliance it would appear that the BJP   s rivals can do little but hope that Prime Minister Modi squanders his goodwill over the next two years in a series of political missteps and administrative failures in delivering on promises.If Uttarakhand, as in the case of Uttar Pradesh, stuck to the 2014 script, Punjab voted very differently. The BJP was only a junior partner in the alliance led by the Shiromani Akali Dal. Also, the alliance suffered greatly from the anti-incumbency factor, having completed two terms in office. Actually, Punjab was more important for the Congress than it was for the BJP. A loss to the emerging Aam Aadmi Party would have been disastrous, with long-term implications across the country. But the fact that the party held off the challenge from Arvind Kejriwal   s party is in no small measure thanks to Captain Amarinder Singh, its chief ministerial candidate. In recent years, the Congress and the BJP have reversed their roles. The Congress, which once boasted of strong national leaders and little-known regional satraps, is now in a situation where it needs strong leaders at the State level to make up for Rahul Gandhi   s relative lack of charismatic appeal at the national level. The Congress cannot afford to be in the hands of a small and insular coterie. If it is to replicate elsewhere its success in Punjab, the party needs to learn from Amarinder Singh, who was much more alive to the threat from the AAP than the national leadership was. As the BJP concentrates power in the hands of one person, a risky as well as undesirable approach to adopt for any party, the Congress needs to do exactly the opposite. No matter what it believes of itself, the Congress is no longer the natural party of government. It is the BJP that has emerged to occupy this space in the altered political environment. Whether the party likes it or not, the Congress will have to build a credible opposition to the BJP, little by little, State by State, instead of trying to pit Mr. Gandhi against the vastly more experienced Mr. Modi in what is clearly an unequal battle.For the Congress, there is little comfort to be had in finishing as the single largest party in Manipur and Goa. Given that the BJP is in power at the Centre, the smaller parties might be more inclined to back a non-Congress government in the two States. Even if it does manage to form the government in one or both States, the Congress will find it difficult to ensure political stability. That the BJP was able to substantially increase its presence in Manipur is perhaps an indication of things to come in the rest of northeastern India. However, while it can claim it did well in Manipur despite finishing behind the Congress, the BJP will be hard put to explain its somewhat lacklustre performance in Goa, where it was in power and suffered a steep fall in votes in comparison to 2014. But even if the Modi magic has its limits and cannot work at the same level everywhere, 2017 showed that 2014 was no flash in the pan. The BJP is now the natural party of government, and the performance of the Congress will depend on how well it is able to combine with other Opposition parties.",other,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/allowing-for-a-sibling/article17453726.ece,"This January, China   s National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) announced that there were 17.86 million births in 2016, a 7.9% increase from 2015 when the country   s controversial one-child policy came to an end. About 45% of babies were born to families that already had one child, it said. The NHFPC also anticipates a baby boom, estimating the number of births annually to be between 17 and 20 million by 2020.In February, the NHFPC said the government was contemplating incentives to parents so that they would not be deterred by the economic burdens that would result from having a second baby. Providing maternity and paternity leave and provisions for parents to attend to sick children are among the proposals.The two claims may seem contradictory, but they are not. The confusion can be ascribed largely to the relegation in reportage, over the decades, of the regional variations in the enforcement of the one-child norm, which was always selective in its application, with several significant exemptions underpinning the rule.Wrestling with old virtuesIn the 1970s and    80s, the Chinese were schooled in the virtues of not adding to the number of children to be fed and clothed. Correspondingly, offspring of the one-child era have become alive to the opportunity cost of raising a larger family. Moreover, official surveys point to a large number of women who are not particularly keen to have a second child. Also, there is an estimated decline of a few million in the number of women in the child-bearing age in the coming years. This is the context for additional incentives to sustain the recent rise in child births.Regarding the selective nature of the one-child policy, the 2015 shift removed its last remnant. Under a 2013 relaxation, a couple was permitted to have two children if either parent was an only child. That was an improvement on the 2000 exemption, which allowed couples to have a second child only if both parents had no siblings. There were other concessions too, in rural areas, such as the option to have a second child if the first-born was either a girl or a disabled infant. A still less noticed, but nonetheless important, exemption was the freedom national minorities were allowed from the population control policy.Thus, the prospects of the current approach would necessarily vary, depending on the extent to which people in different regions took advantage of the easing of the earlier norm. A challenge for the Chinese government would be to raise investment in the provision of child-care services, when it is already faced with a large ageing population and shrinking numbers in the working-age population.",other,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-limits-of-identity-politics/article17453724.ece,"The BJP   s victory in U.P. is quite a watershed. The party has come to power in the State before, but never with such a high vote share (more than 41% along with allies). Yet, besides the BJP   s win, what is significant in this election is the rout of the SP and the BSP, two representatives of the    Mandal era    or, more accurately, lower caste assertion in Indian politics.As political scientist Christophe Jaffrelot argues in his book, India   s Silent Revolution , the evolution of India   s post-Independence polity     from being dominated by a single party (the Congress) to a multifarious, deeply    regionalised    system     was made possible by a    silent revolution    of the lower castes. This revolution played itself out distinctly and during a different time period but surely in south and north India. It resulted in the Other Backward Classes occupying centre-stage in politics, a process that was accelerated after the implementation of the Mandal Commission recommendations in politics. The rise of the BSP, from an interest group representing the Dalits to a political force, is also documented in the book.   Ethnic parties   , as political scientist Kanchan Chandra termed them in her book, Why Ethnic Parties Succeed , managed to do well in States where voters registered their political choice based on the ethnic head count of support for the party. This choice was also because U.P. and other parts of India had a patronage democracy, where the government could monopolise resource distribution on an ethnic basis. But politics of this kind is limiting. With the SP   s strongest support and dominant ethnic base restricting itself to the Yadavs and Muslims, and the BSP   s to the Jatavs, there was always the possibility of resentment among other communities limiting the chances for these parties.In the run-up to the 2017 elections, the SP noticed this frailty and sought to project Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav as the face of development, taking a leaf from Prime Minister Narendra Modi   s book. The BSP, on the other hand, attempted something new, a coalition of the    underprivileged    in a Dalit-Muslim alliance, but which echoed the same parameters that were set for ethnic identity politics in U.P.The reasons for the success of the BJP needs to be studied more thoroughly. But it is clear that the politics practised by the SP and the BSP has reached a cul-de-sac and requires reinvention. Perhaps these parties could go beyond ethnic head counts and address the real reasons for lower caste assertion.",other,,

Monitor actions   Noting that High Courts should monitor action plans for lower courts and keep a constant watch, the Supreme Court said the timelines prescribed in the judgment would be used to assess judicial performance in the annual confidential reports of judicial officers.Noting that 50% of the population in jails consisted of undertrial prisoners, and long periods of incarceration without bail or trial was human rights violation, the judgment said those undertrials who had already completed their entire period of their sentence, had they been found guilty, should be released on personal bond.The court held that liberal adjournments of cases must be avoided and witnesses once produced must be examined on consecutive dates.

The spectacular victory of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand will give the party all the elbow room it needs in the Rajya Sabha, where it has been impaired by a lack of numbers thus far.In almost a year from now, elections will be held to 58 Rajya Sahba seats, including the largest chunk of 10 from Uttar Pradesh, eight of which the BJP is in a position to win.Current numbersNow, the Samajwadi Party holds six of those 10 seats, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) two (including the seat of party chief Mayawati), and the BJP and the Congress one each.The retirement of these MPs means the BJP   s kitty going up in the Rajya Sabha. The SP will be reduced to 13 seats from the current 18, and the BSP to four from six. Pramod Tiwari of the Congress too will retire from the Upper House next April.Some of the other States that will be sending in members are Madhya Pradesh (five seats), Maharashtra (six), Gujarat (four) and Rajasthan (three), all of which ruled by the BJP. Andhra Pradesh will send in three new members in that round of polls. The BJP, at present, has 56 seats in the Upper House, three short of the Congress tally of 59. The Congress numbers are often boosted by oppositional unity on certain issues. The large number of members being rotated from the States where the BJP is now in power will change that situation.Presidential pollsWhen it comes to the presidential election too, the BJP has nearly covered the gap to the magic number.The presidential polls are held based on an electoral college of MPs of both Houses of Parliament and MLAs of State legislatures, with each vote accorded weight according to the population of the State and other calculations.The electoral college has 10,98,882 votes. After Saturday   s verdict, the NDA is only short of 24,552 votes, where the gap was 79,274 earlier.

http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sweet-spot-in-eye-helps-humans-read/article17453681.ece,"Wonders of evolution:A region in the eye called the fovea is responsible for visual experiences rich in colourful detail.AFPEver wondered why humans can read? A team led by Kolkata-born scientists has found that a special sweet spot in the eye called    fovea    plays a crucial role in humans being able to focus on computer screens and also read, an ability which is unique to Homo sapiens .The findings decipher the mechanism that lets humans read the text, recognise faces, enjoy colours, say the scientists.Dr. Raunak Sinha and Dr. Mrinalini Hoon describe themselves as a    scientist couple    who push the frontiers of neuroscience to better understand vision.Dr. Sinha says this    recent breakthrough in understanding how the most important aspects of our vision works at a cellular level. This work illustrates the physiological basis of how our central vision, mediated by the region in the eye called fovea, works at a cellular level and how it differs in its operation from the region that mediates our peripheral vision   .Vision scientists have uncovered some of the reasons behind the unusual perceptual properties of the eye   s fovea. Among mammals, only humans and other primates have this dimple-like structure in their retinas.Owls, some other predatory birds, and some reptiles have a similar structure. The fovea is responsible for our visual experiences that are rich in colourful spatial detail.How fovea functionsFiguring out how the fovea functions is essential to the search for strategies to correct central vision loss, including efforts to design visual prosthetics.   Diseases such as macular degeneration are much more debilitating than deficits in peripheral eyesight because of the importance of the fovea to everyday vision,    says Dr. Sinha of the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at the University of Washington   s, School of Medicine.The fovea is a specialised region that dominates our visual perception, he explains. It provides more than half of the input from the eyes to the visual cortex of the brain.   When you look at a scene an arm   s length away,    he says,    the fovea subtends a field only about the size of your thumbnail. Our eyes undergo rapid movements to direct the fovea to various parts of the scene.   The absence of a fovea in most mammals, he says, and technical challenges associated with recording from the primate fovea, led to a paucity of information about how the fovea operates at the level of cellular circuits.Using advanced techniques, Dr. Sinha helped lead a study that revealed that the computational architecture and basic visual processing of the fovea are distinct from other regions of the retina.The results help explain why central and peripheral vision have different qualities, he says.For fine tasksLocated near the optic nerve, the fovea is at its best for fine tasks like reading. Compared to the peripheral retina, however, the fovea is less able to process rapidly changing visual signals.This low sensitivity is what makes us see motion in flipbooks and movies. It   s also what prevents us from seeing flicker when a computer or TV screen refreshes, unless we glance at the screen (especially the old-fashioned CRT monitors) from the corner of our eye, Dr. Sinha explains.Past recordings of foveal output signals in the living eye had demonstrated that the perceptual specialisations of foveal vision originated largely in the retina itself, rather than in subsequent brain circuits.Nonetheless, Dr. Sinha says, little was known about the cellular and circuitry basis of these functional specialisations due to a lack of intracellular recordings from foveal neurons.The team from the Howard Hughes Medical Center research team recently made one of the first direct comparisons of the physiological properties of foveal and peripheral retinal neurons and among the first correlations between structure and function in the fovea.Publishing their work in the journal CELL , their experiments revealed how differences in the cellular and circuit mechanisms of foveal and peripheral retina can account for the well-established differences in their perceptual sensitivities.The latest study provides one of the first glimpses into how the fovea works at a cellular and circuit level. It turns out to be very different from how other regions of the retina operate.Returning to the issue of sensitivity to rapidly changing inputs, Dr. Sinha and colleagues compared the responses of the cone photoreceptors     the neurons that are the frontline of the visual system. They found that the responses of cone photoreceptors in the fovea are about two-fold slower than those in the periphery.   Novelty of the study   This is nearly identical to the differences between central and peripheral vision in the sensitivity to rapidly changing inputs. The finding suggests that the perceptual differences originate in the cone photoreceptors themselves.   The novelty of this study is bolstered by a comprehensive structure-function analyses, lacking in previous work on the fovea, using techniques such as particle-mediated gene transfer to study protein expression in a diverse array of ganglion cells,    says Dr. Hoon.",national,West Bengal,Health

If Muslims side with us, then the BJP will be be wiped out from Jat land,    Kapil, a 38-year-old Jat voter in the Hathikaronda village of the Thana Bhawan constituency in Shamli, had told The Hindu after voting on February 11. When the result came out on Saturday, it turned out that he was only a part of a section of the community, albeit a significant part, which remained with the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) till the day of voting. The Muslim candidate of the party, Javed Rao, could get only 31,275 votes in a seat that has over 50,000 Jat votes.Not sustainedAccording to leaders of the RLD, the full-steam party campaign, which was centred on Jat anger against the BJP for not providing reservation to the community and    exploiting    it in the aftermath of the riots, could not sustain till the day of voting. Over half of the community, especially its young, chose to side with the BJP by the time the election day came.So the party that had nine MLAs in the previous Uttar Pradesh Assembly ended up with just one MLA from its traditional bastion of Chhaprauli in Baghpat, which the party managed to win with a small margin of 3,842 votes. It fared badly in its bastions of Baghpat, Mathura, Muzaffarnagar and Shamli. In the Baraut seat in Baghpat, and Mant and Baldev in Mathura, the party managed to take the second spot. The RLD lost the Mant seat by just 432 votes. In the rest of the seats, it came a distant third or even several notches down. Its vote share varied between 40,000-20,000 in areas that used to be its strongholds.Several party leaders at the district level told The Hindu that the BJP, which had a poor relationship with the community at the beginning of the campaign, had by the end of it successfully managed to communicate to the Jat community that their vote against the BJP would only    aid and ensure formation of a government by Muslims.   Vote share risesThough party workers highlighted that the only consolation to the RLD leadership was that the party increased its vote share to 15,45,676 which was    more than double its vote share in Lok Sabha polls   , its poor performance in its strongholds was just the beginning of a fresh crisis for survival for the party.   The audio recording of Amit Shah   s meeting with the Jat leadership, which was strategically leaked, had quite an impact on the community. It actually scared the community and got at least half of the Jats to its side by the time the Jat[-dominated] lands went to polls on February 11. Finally it was Hindu consolidation in the BJP   s favour. So even though we did manage to get a significant share of Jat votes, that was certainly not enough to win,    said a senior party leader on condition of anonymity, even as the top RLD leadership kept mum.Ashok Baliyan, a Jat farmer activist in Muzaffarnagar told The Hindu that making Jat anger central to its campaign, the RLD had sent across a message of defeating the BJP, but it did not offer anything concrete to the Jat youth, which led to their desertion of the party.",national,,Politics

A senior official in the Intelligence establishment told The Hindu that the    time gap    between the Lucknow encounter and the time when the message was circulated on the Telegram channels showed that the IS was not directly behind it.Saifullah was part of the alleged terror module, which planted a bomb on a train near Bhopal on March 7. The messages have been circulating on mobile application Telegram since March 9, two days after the incident.An official said they were suspicious of the message as it was not posted by the official channels of the IS, but by a group supporting the terror organisation and was part of    casual conversation    among its sympathisers.Police backtrackedAfter initially claiming that the nine-member module belonged to the IS, the Uttar Pradesh police retracted the statement and said the group was    self radicalised    and was inspired by the IS.Home Minister Rajnath Singh also did not mention IS in his statement to Parliament.

The announcements vary in scope, with some companies, for example, still permitting use of ionophores, antibiotics not used in human medicine.   We   re seeing a cry from consumers for meat that   s responsibly raised,    said Lena Brook, a food policy advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).While an estimated 40 to 50% of U.S. chicken now is antibiotic-free, the percentage is far lower for pork and beef.Moreover, several leading companies have resisted action. Kentucky Fried Chicken, part of Yum Brands, currently scores an    F    on an NRDC scorecard on antibiotics policy, while Sanderson Farms, a leading US chicken producer, has lampooned the trend.Experts in animal farm science say U.S. farmers for decades routinely employed antibiotics as a means to speed growth rates for animals, and to prevent disease outbreaks on farms where animals are frequently packed in close quarters.But an April 2014 World Health Organization report warned of the potential for a    post-antibiotic era    in which    common infections and minor injuries can kill    as drugs become ineffective.In voluntary guidelines that took effect in January, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said antibiotics in agriculture should be limited to medically necessary uses and not for weight gain.The call by public officials has dovetailed with heightened consciousness about food in broader American society that has also propelled organic food.Instead of antibiotics, Tyson is turning to probiotics and to botanicals such as oregano and thyme for routine treatment, while still employing antibiotics if birds become sick, a spokesman said. Tyson, which has faced shareholder resolutions on its water policy and other sustainability issues, also plans to limit antibiotics in pork, beef and turkey.Advocates of stricter antibiotic use are pressing for action on beef and pork too. Since beef already has more premium grades, adding antibiotic-free products could be another opportunity to introduce a pricier product, said Zain Akbari, a food industry analyst at Morningstar.",national,,Others

We all should take a pledge of something good that we want to contribute to the country and promise to fulfil that pledge by 2022,    Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, addressing party workers here.His personal app, NaMo app, has been running this pledge since late on Sunday afternoon, with subscribers being asked to dedicate five years to the cause of their choice, ranging from women   s empowerment to fighting corruption, to promoting cashless transactions.After taking a decisive pro-poor shift in policy and in campaign rhetoric in the recent elections, including a loan waiver for farmers and no interest on agricultural credit, Mr. Modi had some words of solace for the middle class, whose burden, he said, could only be lightened by an empowered poor.    In many cases, the middle class has to bear the burden of paying taxes, of maintaining public services etc. That burden must be lightened, and that can only happen when the poor are empowered. My vision for    New India    is about empowering the poor with opportunities, the only thing that will propel India forward,    he said.Lauding BJP president Amit Shah, Mr. Modi tried to allay fears of a majoritarian government in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand (where the party did not field a single Muslim candidate), saying that once elected, governments had    no right to discriminate   .",national,,Politics

http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mea-cuts-funds-to-one-more-china-think-tank/article17453782.ece,"After cancelling a fund for the prestigious Delhi-based Institute for Chinese Studies (ICS), the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has reportedly informed another research group on China that it will not be able to support their programmes.   We will overcome the challenges posed by the fund cut, but such an attitude towards conducting comprehensive academic research on China would hurt the foreign policy debates on China in India,    said Jawaharlal Nehru University Professor B.R. Deepak, who has been one of the scholars of the Association of Asia Scholars (AAS).In the past few weeks, the MEA has come under criticism for its decision to revise many of the grants and funds it disburses to think tanks. While the ministry declined to comment on the criticism, a senior MEA official told The Hindu that the cuts were not the outcome of larger budget cuts from the government, but had been taken on the basis of    the performance and delivery    of think tanks that have been allocated a combined Rs. 6.5 crore in the Budget.   Over the past few years, we have been trying to inject some accountability into the system, in an effort to get more results from the think tanks,    the official explained, defending the government   s decision.   Project by project   While the ICS had seen an annual fund outlay of Rs. 1 crore cancelled and replaced with funding on a    project by project    basis, sources said the AAS was told its seminars and programmes could not be funded as they were too    academic in nature, and not helpful in the government   s policy design   .Speaking out against the government   s decision on the ICS, which was started in 1969 and is one of the most respected think tanks in the field, outgoing director Alka Acharya told The Hindu :    Project-based funding is efficient in that it focuses on specific outcomes or outputs. However, that alone cannot substitute the sustained core support required to nurture the high-quality human-resources necessary     not only to pursue those projects but to build the range and depth of knowledge and expertise about China that India needs today.   Fellows of the ICS as well as the AAS did not wish to speak about whether their fund cut came because of what one official called    diametrically opposite positions to the government    on important issues like China   s Belt & Road initiative as well as on border talks.A senior China scholar, however, said such differences are a sign of academic dynamism and creativity.    Funding from the government does not make a think tank into an advocacy group. Our difference of opinion is based on the study of a particular project and therefore there is no question of agreeing on all issues with the MEA,    he said.Responding to other criticism on the government   s decision to support programmes organised by foreign think tanks, including a Global Technology Summit conducted by the India arm of the Carnegie think tank in Bangalore, the MEA official said recent entrants to India like Carnegie, Brookings Institution etc., are no longer considered foreign.   These are hardly foreign think tanks any more, as they are staffed mostly by Indians,    the official said, acknowledging that the decisions mark a shift from previous MEA policy and were part of a    revamp    of the policy planning division that now handles all think tank funding.",national,,Others

(MTAL), the Indo-Russian company that was to have spawned India   s own military transport aircraft, is wound up.The closure of the company, when it happens, will formally bury a decade-old plan to co-design and co-develop a cargo/transport plane for the armed forces of the two nations.The project appears to have gone cold at least a year back and there has been no official word on the status of the government-to-government deal, whereas Russia is reportedly going ahead with its new plane for its armed forces, according to sources.MTAL, which has been idle for almost two years, has a CEO, a company secretary and a head of finance. The board of Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), which is an equal partner in the venture, may take the matter to its closure once it gets the nod, it is learnt.Not entirely unexpectedA hint of this came during the February Aero India 2017, when HAL chairman and managing director T. Suvarna Raju said,    The MTA (Multi-role Transport Aircraft) project is not progressing well. As of now, no work is going on and it is currently in the    stop    mode. We will be knowing about its future in the current year.    It was up to the two governments to look at options, he said. The Indian Air Force (IAF) is yet to respond to a query on the project.   No Indian company has designed a transport plane. We lost that opportunity,    said a person familiar with aircraft design, who did not wish to be named.Joint development of the plane, MTA, was conceived around 2006-07 and firmed up in 2010 via an inter-governmental agreement. Two years later, HAL and Russian military entities     United Aircraft Corporation-Transport Aircraft (UAC-TA) and Rosoboronexport     signed a general contract to form the special purpose MTAL, with a 50:25:25 equity split to take the project forward. Each side put in $20 million as paid-up capital.According to the old plan, the 15-20-tonne medium lift plane would replace the ageing Antonov /An-32 transport planes. The demand was estimated at 205 MTAs     45 for the Indian Air Force, 100 for the Russian Air Force and another 60 for exports. The Indian aircraft was to be designed by HAL in Bengaluru and produced at its transport division in Kanpur. The project cost was estimated at $600 million (then around Rs. 2,700 crore).In 2012, over two dozen HAL engineers spent several months in Russia studying the project. Until March 2014, designers of either side had together completed the preliminary project design. Subsequent reports said problems such as an incompatible engine design, performance issues at higher altitudes and cost escalation had cropped up.While the An-32s are now proposed to be upgraded, this can only be done with the help of Ukraine, which is in conflict with Russia. The first An-32 upgraded earlier was lost over the sea near Chennai last July.In December 2015, three joint projects were alive between the two countries: the MTA, the Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft and the light helicopter Kamov Ka-226. But the line for the MTA appears to have died, the sources said.",national,,

They make the arduous trip several times a week. It is the only way to get the treatment and therapy Sophia needs for an ominous array of problems caused by the Zika virus.Now more than a year old, Sophia is a child of the Zika epidemic, one of nearly 2,500 babies in Brazil born to infected mothers, with brain damage so profound the consequences are only beginning to be understood.Disastrous impactIn November, the World Health Organization lifted its emergency designation from the mosquito-borne virus, but Zika has hardly disappeared.For families of Zika babies, however, the disastrous effects are only deepening.Many babies also have a long list of varied symptoms, leading experts to rename their condition    congenital Zika syndrome   .They can have seizures, breathing problems, trouble swallowing, weakness and stiffness in muscles and joints preventing them from even lifting their heads, clubbed feet, vision and hearing problems, and ferocious irritability.While the children are still small enough to be held, fed and carried, ultimately, many may be unable to walk, attend regular schools, or live on their own as adults.   Grave risk of aspiration,    read the piece of paper near the bed where Vera L  cia da Silva was wrapping Sophia in a pink hooded fleece for their middle-of-the-night walk to the van. A doctor had explained what that medical report meant.    She is going to choke,    Vera L  cia da Silva said, twisting her fingers anxiously.    Food is going to go to her lungs.   Sophia had serious dysphagia, swallowing problems afflicting older Zika babies whose brains cannot coordinate skills for eating. Doctors advised adding thickener to her formula, but if unsuccessful, she would need a feeding tube threaded through her nose. A previous feeding tube had caused Sophia to vomit black blood.After another dead-of-night van ride to Recife and hours of waiting, Sophia was placed on an elevated mat at the Altino Ventura Foundation clinic.Five therapists examined her. One shook a yellow rattle by her ear. Another removed Sophia   s tiny lavender eyeglasses, waved a shiny silver pompom and flickered a flashlight, but her eyes seemed barely able to follow the stimuli.

Industry players said that these should be addressed on a priority basis.AFPWith manufacturing gradually picking up and several emerging sectors opening up new opportunities, the more than $18 billion Indian foundry or casting industry is looking to double growth rates.The sector, which has been reporting a growth of 5-7 % in the last few years, is expected to clock 13-14% growth in the next couple of years, said top industry officials.India is the world   s third-largest casting producer after China and the U.S. While China accounts for 40% of the world   s 105 million tonnes casting production, the U.S. and India each do between 11 and 12 million tonnes per year.   Pan India, the targeted growth rate is 13% to 14% as compared with about 5% to 7% currently. This is due to Make in India and other efforts made by the government to rejuvenate the economy,    said Ravi Sehgal, an industry veteran who recently organised the 65th edition of the Foundry Congress.   Growth in the auto industry, agriculture sector and the earth moving industry has given us new hopes. Once the mines reopen, business is set to grow,    he added.A couple of years ago, the industry was passing through a tough time with many units shutting down due to lack of business. But now, there is optimism.   Bloodshed has stopped      The bloodshed has stopped. In the future there are more opportunities and people have understood that they would focus on technology as new opportunities are going to provide growth,    said said Anil Vaswani, President, Institute of Indian Foundrymen (IIF), the apex body of the Indian foundry industry.   Though the industry is hit by demonetisation and the effect of GST is yet to come, still, there is a sense of positivity. With the opportunities, we are doubling the growth targets,    he said.The growth is expected to come from agriculture, infrastructure, water pipes, wind turbines, automotive, railways, defence and oil & gas sectors, industry players said.   Emerging opportunities are investment in infrastructure, in oil and gas within the country, mining sector, railways and defence. These sectors will drive the future of the industry,    said Dr. Nithyanandan Devaraaj, National Secretary of IIF.   The money that will come into manufacturing will drive the growth of the foundry industry. This will also help in employment generation as well,    he said.Industry players said the first two years of the NDA government did not deliver any major infrastructure projects. But now that the government has actually settled in, it is kick starting infrastructure development, they said.Large orders are expected from the railways sector as more than 2,000 locomotives are to be manufactured in India. New rail lines also provide opportunities for the foundries, industry executives said.While automotive, the main stay of the sector, is picking up, the tractor industry is also poised for growth as India had a good harvest this year.More mechanised methods of farming to improve yield will be required to double the income of farmers as set by the government. The budget   s thrust on farmers will help the foundry industry, officials said.Earth-moving equipment is set to get a boost from mid-2017.The central government   s decision to provide clean drinking water in every village will also augment business for the sector.Thousands of kilometres of pipes will be laid. The pipes will need lot of fittings, valves and controls. These will give a boost for the casting industry for the next 5 years, sources said.Companies in the sector are expecting to boost their exports as well.   The Indian casting industry caters to only 4% of the global market. We can scale up the exports further and do good for the sector. If we can achieve 6-7%, we will be almost doubling the capacity. So, there is huge potential for exports,    Mr. Seghal said.Challenges aheadDespite the opportunities, the industry is faced with several challenges and these need to be addressed on a priority basis.The main challenge bogging the industry down is lack of resources for technology upgradation and access to quality manpower.   The biggest challenge that we are facing is from the consumer durable industry which is not paying the right price. The consumer durable industry has to be more supportive,    said Dr. Devaraaj.   If we get better prices in the market, we will be able to upgrade the technology. As long as the foundries do not get the right prices, investment will not come. Similarly, we need to pay more to attract talent and earn more to make it attractive for the next generation to join the business,    he added.Since a career in the foundry industry is not typically sought out by aspiring youth entering the workforce, attracting new talent has become a challenge. So, the perception on the foundry industry has to change and the industry needs to be profitable to pay higher wages.Companies need to upgrade the technology and make their foundries clean, non-polluting, and provide worker-friendly environments.Indian players are facing huge quality issues in the export markets.Cost of fuel and power in India is almost double that in China, Germany and even Turkey. The government has to address this problem to make India internationally competitive, players said.   If skill development and technology upgradation are taken up urgently, we can take care of 60% of the problem,    said Mr. Vaswani.SMEs laggingToday, the situation is such that while the large foundries are succeeding, the small and medium-sized ones are struggling to survive.   Casting industry is a low margin industry and unless people do value addition it would be difficult to survive,    Dr. Devaraaj said.Besides, large corporate and OEMs, which are profiting through the Make in India policy, are seen not passing on the benefits to the value chain.   Most MNCs in the SEZs are raking in the profits and business is not coming to Indian foundries,    alleged Dr. Devaraaj.   The OEMs must start to nurture the casting industry. The government has done its bit. Now it is for the OEMs to support with better sourcing and pricing,    he added.Trade protectionism is another issue that the that the industry needs to deal with. Today, there is a significant amount of exports to the U.S. as well as Europe.If, under the Donald Trump administration, the U.S. bans import of casting or if it steeply increases import duties, the industry would then have a challenge to deal.In that case, Europe will become a major destination for exports followed by other counties in Latin America and Africa.Coimbatore is the largest foundry cluster in India having 300 to 400 foundries focusing on technology and value-addition. The cluster is focused on steel castings, pump bodiesand forging components. Second comes the Kolhapur cluster, focused on automotives.While Rajkot is emerging as another cluster, Belgaum and Shimoga are also rising in a big way in the South. Other clusters include those in Howrah, Faridabad, Agra, Jalandhar and Batala. India has about 5,000 foundries making all types of castings.While 5-10% of them are very large foundries, about 30% are medium-sized ones with an annual turnover of Rs. 100 -150 crore. The rest are small and micro units.   A majority of the foundries in India are SME foundries. These are very small and very valuable. They are the ones in maximum need of assistance from the Government in terms of technology, automation, rejection reduction and efficiency improvement,    said Mr. Vaswani.Growth in automotives, agriculture and earth-moving has given us new hopeRavi SehgalIndustry veteranGrowth in automotives, agriculture and earth-moving has given us new hopeRavi SehgalIndustry veteran",business,,

What has been the    Trump Effect    on global business?Politically and economically, we have a certain degree of uncertainty. In the pre-Trump era, we spoke about advancing globalisation.

If they (the government) make our lives easier and if the slogan    Make in India    is changed to    Made for India   , it will make India   s economy stronger.Wouldn   t policy changes affect ground reality?Today, when I meet Indian industrialists visiting London, I don   t see happy faces. They all feel nothing is happening. I (myself) don   t get the same feeling because wherever we have invested, the returns have been substantial. Gulf Oil, IndusInd Bank or Ashok Leyland (all Hinduja subsidiaries) are doing good. We need to get the fear out of the business people to help our economy grow.What is that fear?The system of black money in sectors such as luxury goods and jewellery ensured that these areas did not grow. Without adequate cash at their disposal, they are heavily impacted. But there is a dire need for long-term balance. We have to have patience.Ashok: Demonetisation is a bold decision. Nobody has taken such a decision in a vast economy like India. The economy   s cash component has gone into the banking system. Traders used cash to do business. Now, that will also become part of the formal economy. There will be some initial impact as people   s habits will need to change. But we will have to wait and watch. I also feel tax generation will become much better.What has been the impact on banks?Gopichand: Banks are flush with funds, but remember that they are also sitting with Rs. 5 lakh crore worth of bad loans. The credit offtake will depend on economic growth. We haven   t seen big capital expenditure happening. If that had been the case, the credit offtake would have also happened. As a result, banks have money, but are not willing to take decisions. Our group had committed to invest $10 billion in distressed assets. Unless these assets are economically viable, why will any new investor come and invest? To make it economic viable, no bank is willing to take a decision. They are scared to take decisions because of investigations.Promoters also need to get their skin in the game. Why should banks take all the risk?Ashok: If the cost of money is, say, 11-12% and unless the buyer makes 5-8% in returns, why will he take the risk? So, who takes that decision of the haircut? And a majority of that is lying in the public sector and public sector banks will not take any decision. They don   t want to get into trouble. If they take any decision to exit, tomorrow they will be investigated.Gopichand: They (promoters) are scared and prefer to wait and watch. Tell me one infrastructure decision that has been fast and quick. Well, the ease of doing business has improved, but still has a long way to go. Currently, if someone asks me whether I will invest in infrastructure, the answer is    no   The government says it has periodic reviews for clearances to infrastructure projects.Who is conducting those reviews? The bureaucrats. If the ones holding up projects for bureaucratic delays are the same ones to conduct a survey, what results do you expect? At least once a month, the PM should review big turnkey projects.Your commitment to investing $10 billion in distressed assets in India?If the policies are clear and I don   t have to come here again and again to change my shoes, yes, we will. Otherwise, no. There is no dearth of money. Everyone knows that India is a good destination with great potential and opportunity. The concern is of delay and how to do business.Are delays the only concern?Yes, delay is the only concern. If there were no delays and the policies were clear, we would have loved to make all our investments here. Even today, NRI investments are not treated on par with domestic investments. Is Ashok Leyland an Indian company or a foreign company? The whole world says it is Indian, but when you go to government, they say 51% is foreign as it   s held by Hinduja Automative.(For full interview visit http://bit.ly/2mWLtbO)If there were no delays and the policies were clear, we would have loved to make all our investments heregopichand hinudjaIf there were no delays and the policies were clear, we would have loved to make all our investments heregopichand hinudja",business,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/reforming-trade-in-agriproducts/article17453709.ece,"Trading of agricultural commodities in India has been crippled by multiple structural and regulatory issues. Traditionally, the lack of liquidity, quality testing and assurance, and guarantee of delivery kept small farmers as well as institutional traders sceptical of the market. The grant of repository licences to CDSL and NCDEX and the ongoing discussions by SEBI to introduce commodity options are positive signs.Currently, a farmer can take the produce from the farm to a certified warehouse, get the quality inspected and receive a negotiable warehouse receipt (WR) with a unique identity (ISIN). This WR can be traded on the exchange like any other negotiable instrument.Theoretically, this works fine and has several advantages. It provides better price realisation for farmers, safer collateral for lenders like banks and NBFCs, a more efficient market place for hedgers and speculators, and better quality and lower disruptions in supply for the end customer. But, in practice, the system faces many issues, as below:Participation by farmersThe typical farm size in India is very small and the total produce of a farm would probably be lower than a single tradable lot at the exchange. Creating a pool of farmers through initiatives like Farmer Producer Companies (FPC) is a good idea, but the initiatives have been slow to take off.Usually the farmer, either directly or through a broker, sells the produce based on the prevailing MSP. Storing produce in a warehouse is often not an option for these farmers. The main reason for this is that the MSP has become the market price instead of being the minimum assured price. It means that the farmer is not incentivised to carry the goods.In countries like Australia and Canada, there are    pool    programs that allow the farmer to sell their harvest at the average price of grain over a period of time. The government could consider enhancing the MSP with more contracting options to allow the farmer to participate in the market movement.Private participationMarket intervention by the government is a major deterrent to private participation. The suspension of forwards contracts, ban on trading of chana and castor in 2016 have had an impact on the volumes and market confidence.The other issue is that the storage cost at certified warehouses is higher than the cost at the non-certified ones, this directly impacts the percentage of produce that gets dematerialised.Finally, in order to encourage private companies to directly buy from the farmers, the rules for purchase and payments at various APMCs need to be standardised and the government should consider introducing standard price adjustments based on location of the farm and the quality parameters. This will help the farmer sell goods at the farm gate conveniently with minimum wastage, and will help private companies adjust the MSP based on the pre-set transportation costs and quality of produce.Currently, due to the above issues, only a niche set of private companies use the agriculture contracts on the exchanges.In summary, our current state is a reflection of the journey we have chosen based on our needs as a country. Food security and rural economy have rightly been the main factors influencing government policies in this sector. The government now needs to create an efficient and robust market to attract investments and talent required for ensuring a bright future for agriculture in India.(The author is director, business consulting, Sapient Global Markets)Government intervention deters private participationGovernment intervention deters private participation",business,,

Local power gear makers    lobby group, the Indian Electrical Equipment Manufacturers Association (IEEMA), has raised a red flag over the issue.IEEMA has cautioned against the associated risks if Chinese firms are allowed to bid and operate transmission projects in India.Huge contractsAfter entering the consumer goods and power generation equipment market in India, Chinese firms are now eyeing the nascent transmission sector where multi-billion dollar contracts are up for grabs.China Southern Power Grid International (HK Company Ltd.), a subsidiary of state-owned China Southern Power Grid Co Ltd., has partnered with CLP India Private Ltd. to build power transmission networks in India. Several Chinese firms are gearing up to participate in bids invited by Central sector and State sector utilities for establishment, operation and maintenance of transmission lines for periods ranging from 25 to 35 years.In bids called for the inter-state transmission system projects involving investments worth more than Rs. 3,000 crore, China Southern Power has submitted qualification documents to build, own and operate power transmission networks in India.The consortium has submitted qualification documents for three projects for which bids were invited.The projects are: transmission systems for an ultra-mega solar park in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, Eastern Region Strengthening Scheme (ERSS)-XXI and the New WR-NR Inter-Regional Corridor.The long-term nature of the contracts ensures that the successful bidder will have ownership over the projects during the entire duration, people familiar with the development said.According to IEEMA, electricity transmission is a critical infrastructure for the economy and has significant bearing on the national security. The outage of one transmission element can have a cascading impact and can lead to a grid blackout situation, putting the military establishment, internal law and security and hospitals at a great risk,It said that from the points of view of data security and control on data communication, these are critical assets.    It is very important to safeguard the transmission system operation from grid stability, grid security as well as data security perspective,    IEEMA said in letters written to various government departments.   As a nation, we are not [on] good terms with China. . We must take extreme caution as it involves the crucial power sector,    said Sunil Misra, Director General, IEEMA.   Power is a critical infrastructure. It is difficult to imagine what will happen if the grid collapses [due to] some ulterior motive. We need to have safeguards,    Mr. Misra added.

Mr Arora, founder and fund manager of Singapore-based Helios Capital, said that the U.S. Fed rate hike is no longer something equity investors fret about, though the prospect of U.S. President Donald Trump   s policies matching his election rhetoric could bring negative shocks. Edited excerpts:Stock markets are expected to give a thumbs-up to the 5 state poll results, particularly the boost for the NDA in U.P. and Uttarakhand. What   s your take?Markets will be up, of course    and it could be a sustained bull run ahead. Everybody feels that developed economies are now seeing a growth uptick because commodity prices are neither too high nor too low. Even Russia and Brazil are no longer under stress. It   s the same thing in India too. Nobody   s making further losses, non-performing assets (NPAs) are not going up and banks are beginning to get interest on their loans. Many people feel that the bull run has gone on for too long, but I think only the U.S. has seen a bull market. India   s mid-cap stocks may have risen, but the Index as a whole, especially in dollar terms, has given virtually no returns since 2011 largely due to currency movements. So this election result is a significant additional positive for the Indian market.What are the negative shocks that could pose a risk from here?The only worry now is Donald Trump is doing whatever he says. For example, if he is going to implement the corporate tax cut, it has to be seen how it will be balanced. Will it be a border tax imposed on all or some from select geographies?I don   t think interest rate hikes (in the U.S.) is a negative any more. The rate is too low and hikes will help insurers, banks and pension funds who are struggling to generate returns. A small hike in interest rates can boost their incomes and ability to invest by billions of dollars    Bank of America is up 100% since Trump came to office and talked of an interest rate hike. Between 2005 and 2007, the U.S. Fed hiked interest rates on at least ten consecutive occasions, but it didn   t matter then. It   s only after a certain tipping point that they matter. So, there is no more fear of Fed hikes. The mood has changed.Do you expect economic reforms to get a greater push now?Well, on one hand, there is the promise of a farm loan waiver for U.P., and on the other, you have reforms such as GST or resolution of NPAs which don   t change course with state assembly outcomes. I think the reforms they couldn   t do earlier, they wouldn   t do now either. So if they want to amend the land acquisition law, I don   t think it will be touched before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. There   s no need to take on everybody on such issues. But reforms and policies that they want to pursue, they can now pursue them much more expeditiously.Bringing a synergy between the Centre and the state government of U.P., with over 200 million people, can be a significant focus area. We must realise that be it in infrastructure or job creation, being able to impact such a large number of people with one stroke can be a big deal for the economy.The only worry now is U.S. President Donald Trump is doing whatever he saysThe only worry now is U.S. President Donald Trump is doing whatever he says",business,,

The decline in January is 43% from the gold imported in the corresponding month in 2016.The sudden decision to demonetise the old, high-value notes led to a massive cash crunch in the country impacting demand for various commodities, including precious metals.According to an RBI assessment paper, after demonetisation, the domestic demand for gold (or gold items) spiked suddenly, with    buyers reportedly willing    to pay huge premiums to dispose of old currency notes with jewellers.   Reflecting this development as well as the seasonal jump, the volume of gold imports surged in November, even above the elevated October level. Gold imports, however, declined sharply in December 2016 and January 2017,    the paper said.The RBI said that around 80% of gems and jewellery purchases in India are made in cash and consumer demand was reported to have been impacted due to the cash shortage.India is one of the largest gold importers in the world, and imports mainly take care of demand from the jewellery industry.In volume terms, the country   s total gold imports declined to 546 tonnes in April-January of this fiscal, much lower than the 892.9 tonnes in the year-earlier period.

It is a system where magnetically levitating capsules are sent at high speeds through low-pressure tubes, thereby potentially reducing transport time     of people and goods     by more than 80%.Such a system is now being developed to connect Abu Dhabi and Dubai.But why is India so excited about it?Hyperloop One, the company developing the technology, has begun an online vote for people to suggest and choose the best route to deploy a hyperloop in their countries. It said the Hyperloop One Global challenge received 2,600 registrants from 90 countries. It then selected 35 semi-finalists from across the world, five of which are from India. The route choices for India are: Bengaluru-to-Chennai (334 km in 20 minutes), Bengaluru-to-Thiruvananthapuram (736 km in 41 minutes), Delhi-to-Mumbai via Jaipur and Indore (1,317 km in 55 minutes), Mumbai-to-Chennai via Bengaluru (1,102 km in 50 minutes), and Bengaluru to Chennai (334 km in 20 minutes).When can we see it in action in India?Hyperloop One has announced its intentions to begin operations in India by 2021. There are also reports that the company has already begun talks with the Indian government to see how to make this possible, and how to combine this with the Make in India mission by sourcing the necessary material locally.Any pros and cons?If approved, such plans would enable India to jump forward in its transport infrastructure and could revolutionise the way business is conducted.Businesses are likely to pay for the premium charged to be able to schedule meetings and presentations cities apart, all in the same day. And this doesn   t even factor in the potential benefits to the goods transport industry.But in a country like India, the flip side of such a system is also clearly visible.

Arvind sent the latter packing for 26. That brought out Pandya, and he wasted no time wresting the initiative.Pandya and Devdhar played sensible cricket, going aerial with the loose balls and rotating the strike. While Devdhar scored most of his runs on the leg-side, including two sixes     off Arvind and Pavan Deshpande     Pandya preferred to stick to the    V    in front, scoring most of his boundaries and his lone six, off J. Suchith, in that area.Devdhar was bowled by Suchith for 78, with Baroda still 77 runs behind.That did not stop Pandya from going for his shots, with an equally attacking Deepak Hooda for company. Arvind got him caught behind for 70 in the 41st over. Hooda and Yusuf Pathan completed the formalities five overs later.Apart from a 64-run opening stand between Robin Uthappa and Mayank Agarwal, and one for 87 runs from R.

He made a point on a course where every regular from the European Tour struggled in varying degrees.Given the high degree of difficulty presented by the DLF Golf and Country Club course, it was hardly surprising to note that only six players could break par on aggregate. In this background, the 38-year-old Indian   s seven-stroke winning margin stood out.For his effort, Chowrasia won $291,660 while joint-fifth Anirban Lahiri received $62,650.Predicting the scoreWhat more, on Tuesday, Chowrasia had put the winning score at -10. On Sunday, this was exactly what he posted. Clearly, his reading of the course and conditions was suitably rewarded.   I feel great as it   s one of the toughest courses I   ve played and won by seven shots. This is the biggest victory of my career. The secret (behind winning) is only hard work, I gave my 100% and I practised a lot on everything.   He kept a calm exterior and looked confident throughout his campaign but contrary to what appeared, the champion said,    I was not comfortable on this course, I was nervous on every single shot. When I finished the (third) round, (in the forenoon today), I knew I had a two-shot lead into the final round. I told myself, I didn   t need birdies, just aiming for pars in the final round.   Chowrasia played 25 holes on this day after being required to finish seven pending holes from the previous round. He started the final round with a two-stroke cushion after firing a hat-trick of birdies for a four-under 68.Right through the round, Chowarsia led by two to eight strokes, thanks also to his nearest rivals Carlos Pigem and Gavin Green who slowly fell back.Jeev   s advice   I just played good this week, obviously some luck, too. Jeev (Milkha Singh) was telling me to calm down and play my own game and don   t look at others. I told him I   ll follow his advice and follow the same routine,    said Chowrasia.The scores: S.S.P.

http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rain-washes-out-final-day/article17453917.ece,"South Africa and New Zealand   s captains both claimed to have gained a psychological edge after rain washed out the final day of the first Test here on Sunday.Despite New Zealand suffering the loss of batsman Ross Taylor for the second Test, captain Kane Williamson felt buoyed by his side being able to establish a 33-run first innings lead.   Good effort      To put partnerships together against the very good attack they have was a good effort,    he said after play was abandoned without a ball bowled on Sunday, leaving South Africa on 224 for six in the second innings, a lead of 191 runs.   You always want more, which never goes away no matter how many you get, but it was nice to get a little lead going into that second innings.   Taylor, who suffered a calf tear early in his innings, has been replaced by debutant Neil Broom for the second Test which starts in Wellington on Thursday.Pace bowler Matt Henry has also been added to the squad with Trent Boult nursing a leg injury.South African captain Faf du Plessis felt the rain had ruined a potential victory, with the Proteas set to capitalise on New Zealand   s injury woes.   When a Test match finishes on a day like today it   s very frustrating,    he said.   If today was a full day of cricket, we felt with (New Zealand) one seamer down and one of the main batters out of the team we fancied our chances. It   s very disappointing from that point of view. We were 190 ahead on a wicket that was spinning quite a bit, purely on the match position if we got 50-60 more runs, a 250 lead and set them that in 50-60 overs, we   d fancy our chances.",sports,,Cricket

It   s the sign for kick-off: one of Iraq   s top football coaches has lost his voice.Cancer forced the 57-year-old to have his larynx removed last year, but it did not stop him coaching Baghdad   s Air Force Club youth team.Sometimes he communicates using an electro-larynx, a small device whose vibrations produce a synthetic voice. When that becomes uncomfortable he resorts to writing on paper, letting an assistant read out his instructions.   Sometimes a look is enough to put across what I want to say,    he says.But on the pitch, hand signals are key.    The key thing I have to tell them is not to argue with the referee. When I raise four fingers on one hand it means they need to press the opponent     they understand that well.   Throughout training sessions and matches, he issues instructions with his arms, one gesture after another.He opens his arms wide and the players spread out across the pitch. He reduces the gap and they adopt a more compact formation.He raises two fingers on one hand and one on the other: two against one, the players mark their opponents.Coaching the Air Force Club youth team since 1998, Flayeh has become one of the most popular coaches in Iraq. But that has not prevented the club from facing financial crisis.    The players have continued their training without getting paid and I haven   t received my salary (about $400) for two months because of the club   s financial situation,    he says.Last year he was forced to sell his car and some personal belongings to finance his laryngectomy in Beirut.To restore his voice, he would need a $50,000 (   47,000) operation in Germany     but he says that is beyond his means.His former players have launched a fundraising campaign to help finance his operation. So far they have managed to raise $3,500.But players say the club   s financial difficulties and Flayeh   s illness have strengthened the relationship between the young recruits and their coach.",sports,,Football
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kohli-frustrated-at-inability-to-score/article17453821.ece,"Mitchell Johnson has said he is of the opinion that Virat Kohli is    frustrated    at not being able to score big runs in the ongoing Test series.   He   s obviously quite passionate, but I just think he   s frustrated because he hasn   t scored [too many runs] and he   s letting his emotions get the better of him,    Johnson wrote in his blog on foxsports.com.au .   Obviously, whenever there   s a wicket, the cameras go straight to Kohli     they know they   re going to get those kind of reactions from him.   And they did! He was giving a send-off to just about every player, which you   ve got to be very careful with.   Johnson recalled the verbal duels he had with Kohli in the past.   I felt completely at home watching the action as Australia and India went toe-to-toe in the second Test because of one man: Virat Kohli. He was in the thick of everything,    Johnson wrote.The fast bowler spoke about a specific incident from the Boxing Day Test of 2014.    He hasn   t had any time for me since the Boxing Day Test in 2014, when he finished the day saying he had no respect for me.   The moment that changed everything was when he blocked a ball back to me and I threw it back at the stumps, seeing Virat was out of his crease and thinking it was a chance of a run out. The only problem was that Virat was in the way.   He got hit in the back, and I apologised straight away because it was a complete accident, but that message didn   t seem to get through. There were plenty of verbals after that and he hasn   t really stopped since.",sports,,Cricket

Indian teams always go quite hard, if you give them a sniff they   ll run with it. Our job is to make sure they can   t get in the game so they can   t get aggressive with us, and then really take the momentum away from us. But it   s not really our issue. We   ve got to play good cricket, and beat them on skill,    Wade said.Change in approachHe said he was shocked by a distinct change in India   s approach between the first and second cricket Test in the ongoing series.   The change from the first Test to the second Test was probably the initial shock. They certainly came out a little harder on day three (at Bengaluru), but we expect them to come hard,    Wade said of the Test that was marked by controversy over skipper Steve Smith   s dismissal.   When you   ve got a caged lion you expect them to come out pretty hard, to get away. Indian teams are always quite aggressive. Dhoni was a different captain to Kohli, but that   s just personality.   About his own approach to the game, Wade said:    I feel like I play my best cricket when I get in the contest. When you   re back   s against the wall you   ve gotta find a way to get up and about, so I still feel like that   s a big part of my game.   Getting older I probably tamed it down a little bit and I probably know when to use it a little bit more now, and when I need it myself.   I probably don   t use it a hundred per cent of the time any more, but I   ve still got it there if I need it. If there   s a time I think it can be an advantage for us, sure     I   ll go for it.",sports,,Cricket

Purely from the reason of what I went through in Australia for something, I feel, was a lot smaller... I   m surprised with it,    he said in Dunedin.du Plessis was fined his match fee during a Test against Australia in November for sucking on a mint and rubbing saliva into the ball.ICC chief executive David Richardson had described it as    an obvious breach    of the ball-tampering law.However, the ICC decided not to take action against Virat Kohli and Steve Smith following accusations of cheating during the Bengaluru Test.du Plessis has always denied ball-tampering and said the reaction from the ICC was different to the way he was treated.

But things never went my way.   I don   t think not being an all-rounder of sorts was a major factor. I admit that the demands are more from a player now and the team is well-settled and doing well,    said Ojha.   I am working on my batting a lot scoring 30s and 40s in Ranji Trophy and becoming a more complete player,    he said.Questioned whether he has any regrets moving to Bengal from Hyderabad, Ojha said,    No, nothing like that. It was a professional call which was also emotional for me.   I had to play for an Elite Group team in Ranji Trophy and since Hyderabad was in Group C, I had to take that decision.   I am glad that Hyderabad has done exceptionally well to make it to the knockout phase in the just-concluded season. I always have that emotional connect with Hyderabad which has given me everything as I grew up playing the game here,    Ojha said.The Hyderabadi takes pride in the fact that he happens to be the only spinner in IPL history to win the Purple Cap given to the highest wicket-taker in a season.   That remains one of my finest moments, apart from being a member of the two winning teams in IPL     Deccan Chargers and later on Mumbai Indians,    said Ojha.On missing out this season, a pragmatic Ojha said he would look forward to the next edition as every team had to go for a complete revamp.   I am capable of playing well to be there in the IPL and for India,    he said.   When the team [India] is settled all you have to do is prepare well consistently and be ready to grab the chance when it comes your way. That is what I am hoping for,    he added.I don   t think not being an all-rounder of sorts was a major factor in me not being in the reckoningI don   t think not being an all-rounder of sorts was a major factor in me not being in the reckoning",sports,India,Cricket

Criticising the    brick wall of intransigence    that her government had faced as it sought to find a deal that protected Scotland   s interests as Britain prepared to leave the EU, Ms. Sturgeon, leader of the Scottish National Party, said that Scotland needed to be given the choice about the    kind of country we want to be   , between the autumn of 2018 and the spring of 2019.   Brexit has made change inevitable    the choice I believe Scotland should have should be what kind of change we want,    she said in Edinburgh on Monday.While the 2014 referendum on independence was pegged as a    once in a generation    vote by former SNP leader Alex Salmond, the issue of independence resurfaced in the wake of last June   s referendum, when Scotland voted overwhelmingly (62%) to remain in the EU. In December, the Scottish government published a white paper    Scotland   s Place in Europe    calling for the U.K. to either remain in the single market or commit to an outcome that would enable Scotland to remain within it, which Ms. Sturgeon said represented a    significant compromise    on the part of her government.   U.K. membership of the single market was ruled out with no prior consultation with the Scottish government, or indeed with other devolved administrations     leaving us facing not just Brexit, but a hard Brexit,    she said on Monday.Ms. Sturgeon   s announcement comes sooner than expected, marking a dramatic twist of events as the government prepares to trigger Brexit as early as Tuesday. The bill that would authorise the government to trigger talks on leaving the EU has returned to the House of Commons and was set to be voted on Monday evening.Debating the detailsMs. Sturgeon said that she would be calling for the vote in the devolved legislature next week that would enable her government to agree details of the procedure with Westminster, which would enable the Scottish Parliament to legislate for an independence referendum. She said the precise question to be put to the people should be up to the Scottish Parliament.She added that the suggested timetable     between 2018 and 2019     was to ensure that voters were able to make as informed a choice as possible, as the shape of the Brexit deal became clear. Leaving it to after Britain left the EU would make it difficult for Scotland that could face a lengthy period outside the EU. Any effort by Westminster to block it from taking place would be like the government attempting to attempts to    puncture Scotland   s life-boat   , having sunk the ship.While the Westminster Parliament could scupper those plans for a referendum, Ms. Sturgeon has previously warned that that would be    disastrous   . On Monday, she noted the government   s previous stance, which was that the referendum should be    made in Scotland, by the people of Scotland   . A second referendum would be    divisive and cause huge economic uncertainty at the worst possible time   , the U.K. government said in a statement on Monday.While Labour would not block a move to hold the referendum should it get the approval of the Scottish Parliament,    Labour will oppose independence because it   s not in the interest of any part of the country to break up the U.K.,    said Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn.While 55.3% of Scottish voters opted to remain in the U.K. in the 2014 independence referendum, recent polls have suggested that gap has narrowed. One poll by Ipsos-Mori published earlier this month found that 50% said they would support independence.",international,Scotland,Politics

I cannot speak for the White House, but I do think the President Trump will be sympathetic to this demand,    he said.   Not only is Pakistan an untrustworthy ally, Islamabad has also aided and abetted enemies of the U.S. for years. From harbouring Osama bin Laden to its cosy relationship with the Haqqani network, there is more than enough evidence to determine whose side Pakistan is on in the war on terror. And it   s not America   s. It is time we stop paying Pakistan for its betrayal and designate it for what it is: a State Sponsor of Terrorism,    Mr. Poe told reporters on a conference call.Terror funding   Pakistan is taking money from the U.S. and at least part of that money is going to terrorists who seek to attack America,    the Congressman said.Mr. Poe had co-sponsored a similar bill in September 2016, which lapsed. The Congressman from Texas said if Pakistan does not support terrorist groups as it claims, it should support the    Pakistan State Sponsor of Terrorism Act of 2017,    since the review would give Pakistan an opportunity to come clean. If it is not supporting terrorism, this will be its opportunity to prove it, he said.   The bill does not designate Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism. It requires the President and the administration to make a determination one way or the other, based on a review of evidence. Pakistan should welcome such a review,    he said.   Pakistan claims to be a victim of terrorism as terrorists carry out attacks in Pakistan too. This is the consequence of government harbouring terrorists,    Mr. Poe said.According to a U.S. State Department document, there are four main categories of sanctions that will follow a state sponsor of terrorism designation        restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance; a ban on defence exports and sales; certain controls over exports of dual use items; and miscellaneous financial and other restrictions.

http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/mfis-understand-rural-customers/article17459205.ece,"RBI had given in-principle approval for 10 institutions to start small finance banks (SFBs) in the country. Among them was ESAF Microfinance, which was set to begin operations as a bank from March 17. In an interview, K. Paul Thomas , founder and chairman, ESAF Microfinance dwelt on the space that SFBs needed to fill. Edited excerpts:What is the significance of asmall financebank in India?The financial inclusion agenda was first mooted about the year 2005. The Swabhimaan campaign was the first such initiative to cover villages with banking facilities.The initiative proved to be a failure due to lack of financial literacy and technology-related issues. A few years ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi furthered the agenda by launching Pradhan-Mantri Jandhan Yojana and later by sanctioning licences to launch Small Finance Banks and Payments Bank. The recent digital push that we witnessed can also be considered as part of the overall agenda. The fact, that 8 microfinance institutions were selected from a total of 10 SFB licences, was a great acknowledgment to the contributions made by the microfinance sector in the field of financial inclusion. Universal banks are not in a position to understand the needs of small-value customers.But, MFIs have been practising financial inclusion for a long time and hence are in a better position to serve the underserved. The credit requirements of these customers are really low. In a country where a majority of the population comes under the low-to-middle income group, this is absolutely important.Many banks have started in India with the objective of inclusiveness. How do you justify your importance?Universal banks have found it difficult to deliver the last-mile connectivity mainly due to issues like lack of proper understanding of the rural population, shortage of appropriate human resources and cost issues. MFIs have employees who understand rural customers and they are always willing to slog it out to reach out to the poor.At ESAF, we give emphasis to client convenience and financial literacy. We deliver door-step service according to the convenience of the clients. Unlike universal banks, we have proved to be the true agents of financial inclusion.As we understand various lifecycle needs of rural customers better, we can develop products and services that aptly serve the assets and liability requirements of the customer.For decades, we have been catering to the small-value loan needs of the rural customer.Now, we have an opportunity to deliver the full bouquet of banking services to rural folk, as they were badly missing it for quite some time.As an MFI, we have set social targets for each branch apart from financial targets. We are bent on taking the same values forward and differentiating ourselves in a more meaningful manner in the banking space.In India, co-operative banks have major presence and participation from people. You are likely to compete with them. How do you gather support to get business?We are here to deliver a promise     the promise of offering personalised attention that has been missing from the entire banking scenario for a long time.This is important when banking is getting more transactional in nature. We know that the scenario is competitive. Hence, we give emphasis to branding and have adequate plans to build brand    ESAF    through multiple platforms.As we communicated through an earlier campaign    we build the nation from the roots   , we will focus more on building the brand through community development. The proof of the pudding is always in the eating. So merely communicating without displaying the essence will only hamper our aspirations. So far we have grown mainly through word of mouth.The community initiatives we have envisaged for the bank will hopefully help us in delivering the same results. We have an interesting and innovative social product in the offing that can disturb the market dynamics. Co-operative banks are permitted to function only in a smaller geography and cannot offer banking services on a wide scale.On the technology side also they are lagging behind. We come with technologically advanced products and state-of-the art digital solutions.We combine the virtues of both co-operative banks and universal banks: the local connect of cooperative banks and technological might of universal banks will reflect in SFBs.We don   t consider co-operative banks alone as our competitors. Maybe for a short time it may count. In the long term, we will consider competition on a wider horizon and will stay relevant to all categories of customers.In that context, RRBs and Local Area Banks have not really succeeded in picking up...Failure of RRBs and LABs led to the formation of these new categories of banks. As I said earlier, the last-mile connectivity can well be executed by the SFBs, who were the leaders in the microfinance domain in various markets. In a country with more than 130-crore population, financial inclusion cannot be achieved through a single stroke. It   s an evolution. SFBs were born out of that evolution and hopefully, I believe this time the authorities have struck the right cord with their objective. The RRBs and LABs were functioning under regulatory restrictions. Thankfully, all those constraints were removed for SFBs.Will you continue your micro-finance business?Yes. Instead of microfinance we are moving in to micro banking. ESAF Microfinance and Investments (P) Ltd., the current company, will continue to be a core investment company. The biggest advantage of becoming a bank is that we can give higher loans and can encourage the savings habit among them. Going forward, ESAF Small Finance Bank will be the flagship brand of ESAF.How many branches will you open in the initial stage? What are your expansion plans?In the initial stage, we will open 85 flagship retail branches and 300 customer touch points through the year. In the long term, we have plans to reach around 500 branches by 2020.Universal banks have found it difficult to deliver last-mile connectivityUniversal banks have found it difficult to deliver last-mile connectivity",business,,

I won   t be surprised if the premia go up as the pricing has already reached rock bottom,    IRDAI member (non-life insurance) P.J. Joseph told PTI.Insurers have zeroed in on over 10 such segments including pharma, power and cement under property and even group health insurance where they are planning to increase the premia going forward. Premia may go up in the range of 10-15% in these segments next financial year.   The market is so competitive that it gives us very little scope for increasing premia. Still, we are working very closely with GIC Re to increase the pricing of over 10 large loss-making portfolios,    National Insurance chairman and managing director Sanath Kumar said.   The floor price of over 10 segments are on our scanner for premium hike, which include pharma, power and cement. We may also see some price revision in group health insurance,    he said, adding,    however, increase will take place in the next financial year only, that too 10-15%.   The largest non-life insurer New India is also set to hike premium in certain segments.   At New India Assurance, the premium hike may happen under segments like fire and group health in the new fiscal,    New India Assurance chairman and managing director G.Srinivasan said.   Premium rates have fallen much below the required rates and hence the rates will have to be readjusted,    he added.New strategyPrivate sector non-life insurer SBI General is working on a three-pronged strategy.   The challenge today is that you have to maintain profitability at a time when investment yields are coming down,    SBI General managing director and chief executive Pushan Mahapatra said.   So, in our bid to maintain profitability, we are working on a three-pronged strategy     better efficiency, better expense control and better selection     and pricing of risk being underwritten,    he added.As of end December, the company had an investment income of Rs. 251 crore, which rose from Rs. 192 crore a year earlier. But in a falling interest rate regime it is not certain whether the bottom line can be protected.However, SBI General   s chief financial officer Rikhil K.

However, we might see an impact on our yield next fiscal.      Substantial pricing   Bajaj Allianz said it had always looked at sustainable pricing.   We have always looked at sustainable pricing. The portfolios and policies underwritten have always been at a price that is commensurate with the risk,    Tapan Singhel, MD and CEO, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, said.

Their financial trend became apparent during the third quarter when they reported losses.At least two of these companies     BCCL and ECL    came out of the BIFR fold about three years ago and while they still carry accumulated losses, they have been making operational profit for close to six years now and their net worth is positive after a financial recast by parent company CIL.Between April and February this fiscal, WCL , which seems to be the worst off, saw its output drop by 5.3% and its offtake decrease by 8.7%.

Moreover, the fortunes of CIL and its arms were affected by the close to 50% drop in the e-auction price in the last quarter. Lower demand by the power sector was the factor here, too.Poor performance of its subsidiaries and provisioning for higher wages (due to ongoing wage negotiations) dented CIL   s third quarter performance.CIL reported a 20% drop in net profit to Rs. 2,884 crore in the October-December 2016 quarter.Share buy-backAs a result of the muted physical and financial performance, these three subsidiaries have not participated in the recent programme of subsidiaries buying back their shares from CIL.The boards of other three subsidiaries have already given their nod for the buy-back following which the CIL Board, on March 11, approved the tender of the shares held by the company in three subsidiaries     MCL, NCL and SECL for about Rs. 4,000 crore.Interim dividendThus Coal India Ltd. would be paying Rs. 9,208 crore to the government this fiscal as interim dividend.

The conversion to BS-IV emission norms, which will come into effect from April, also resulted in some inventory correction taking place across original equipment makers from February.Overall, the industry closed the first 10 months of fiscal 2017 with a growth of 8.3%, which, although better than the industry growth rates over the past four fiscal years, remains a far cry from the double-digit growth prior to November 2016.

However, despite the humiliating defeat in the Lok Sabha elections in 2014, most of the parties that were defeated this time round have still not learnt any lessons.One needs to compliment the BJP for going from strength to strength by sweeping elections, be it civic or Assembly. The party has worked extremely hard to reach this position and it is evident that its efforts are paying off. What the nation lacks now is the presence of a strong Opposition, which is a necessity.Balasubramaniam Pavani,SecunderabadThe resounding victory for the Indian National Congress in Punjab is a much-needed one for the troubled mainstream party (   The Congress   s Punjab lifeline   , March 13). Anti-incumbency against the Badal family, the drug menace, failing law and order, and farmer suicides all worked against the SAD-BJP alliance.

It is a national party based on what the Election Commission of India says.Which party or parties are not nationalist in our country? At the same time, nationalism should not be equated with chauvinism and jingoism, two characteristics that the BJP inherently possesses. A party which has given up the goal of self-reliance in the economy hardly qualifies for the nomenclature of being a nationalist party.The BJP is a party which swears by foreign direct investment in every area of economic activity in the country, while on the cultural front, it is bound by obscurantism and revivalism of the worst kind. It has nurtured storm troopers to attack individuals and groups which beg to differ from the BJP   s obscurantist views. Happenings in Kerala and Mangaluru are examples of this. The long and short of it is that the BJP is a political party like any other in the country. The narcissist views of Mr. Naidu about his party have no substance.G. Ramakrishna,BengaluruOff-field referralIt is a disturbing sight every time the umpire makes a decision to have the batsman or the fielding side grouping to discuss the decision. As a sports fan who has been watching Test cricket for over three decades, I feel that the current systems of the game deprive a viewer of the real moments of a Test match. The rules are so lopsided that we seem to be moving from match to match offering only what sells. The DRS episodes are so ugly that if things continue this way, we are likely to see technology making a complete takeover of the game. We must not forget that umpiring is judgment based on one   s cricketing skills.Pandithar Sivakumar Perumal,Pune",opinion,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-art-of-building-majorities/article17459215.ece,"The State elections of 2017 clearly demonstrate that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has replaced the Congress as the principal national party in the country. It won massive victories in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and emerged as a big player in Manipur. In Goa it remained the single largest party in terms of vote share despite a hugely unpopular outgoing Chief Minister. The only disappointment is Punjab where the party was routed with its senior partner Shiromani Akali Dal after ruling the State for 10 years.The spectacular performance of the BJP in U.P. should not detract from its formidable achievements in the recently concluded local elections, where it made huge strides in previously uncharted territory. In Odisha   s Zilla Parishad elections, the party expanded its footprint from 36 seats in 2012 to 306 in 2017, snatching second place away from the Congress to become a formidable contender to the long incumbent Biju Janata Dal. In Maharashtra, the BJP won eight of 10 municipal corporations with its total number of seats nearly equal to that of all other parties combined.Explaining the riseThe electoral success of the BJP raises an important question. Without being able to meet expectations built up in 2014, in the absence of a surging economy, and with the poor decision on demonetisation, how is the party achieving so much success? There is one obvious reason: Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains very popular while the Congress party   s leadership no longer resonates with voters. However, leadership is not the only factor. The BJP is acquiring hegemonic status in the Indian polity owing largely to ideological consolidation and its creation of an unparalleled election machine.The BJP   s ideology has more takers than before because the party frames the main issues for the elections. Its long-standing ideological association with nationalism renders nationalism an issue on which it has a huge advantage over all other parties. Parties that are able to successfully shape election campaigns around their own issues ultimately succeed in winning elections. By placing a large emphasis on nationalism, the party has cleverly tailored its ideological message to be able to capture the imagination of a larger section of the public. It has opened ideological battlefronts in many different spheres     from universities to movie theatres     and promoted conflicts across the board. It has also placed a large emphasis on other issues that it has traditionally been associated with, such as national security and terrorism, patriotism and more recently, corruption.For a very long time the Jan Sangh and then the BJP relied almost exclusively on the hard-line Hindu nationalists who reside with its ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). This is no longer the case. Hindu traditionalists, those who are drawn to a conservative Hindu way of life but are largely opposed to the hard-line Hindutva world view and its intolerance towards other religions, have now shifted their support from the Congress to the BJP. This allows the BJP to win elections without nominating a single Muslim, as it did recently in U.P.Forging multi-caste coalitionsThe party has also revamped its electoral strategy, one focussed on widening its appeal by stitching together multi-caste coalitions. As is widely known, the BJP   s traditional social base is predominantly upper caste. To increase its support base, it has been building an electoral machine of its own at the local level in the form of caste-based coalitions. Fully aware that the party would not receive much support from the Muslims and perhaps even the Jatavs, the former traditionally associated with the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the latter with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), its leaders targeted the smaller groups that don   t have adequate representation in any of the larger parties. For instance, the BJP tied up with parties like the Apna Dal and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, giving it the support of a large section of the Kurmi and Rajbhar populations, respectively. It also increased its ticket allocations to non-Yadav OBCs and non-Jatav Dalits. Its campaign was led by a galaxy of local and national leaders, together covering an eclectic set of caste groups     almost a Congress-style coalition     but without the Muslims and some Dalit communities.The BJP   s active use of state patronage has also played a big role in strengthening its national footing. In States where the party has come to power, and even at the national level, it has actively worked to break down the existing patronage machinery and replace it with one of its own. For instance, in Maharashtra, a State ruled by the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) for more than a decade before the Devendra Fadnavis government assumed office, the BJP has been steadily dismantling the patronage structures put in place by its predecessors. Through ordinances and amendments, the government has managed to severely weaken the hold of NCP and Congress leaders on the powerful cooperative bodies in the State, including the cooperative sugar factories which have been under the tight grip of NCP leader Sharad Pawar for decades. The government not only created a provision whereby it could appoint independent members to the boards of these bodies, but also imposed restrictions on the existing board members, hailing largely from the Congress or NCP, from contesting elections to particular cooperative banks. At the national level, the Modi government removed scores of previous United Progressive Alliance-era political appointees, particularly those notorious for their role in creating the large NPA (non-performing assets) problem facing the public sector banks today, and replaced them with its own people.Risks of rapid expansionOn the electoral front, this has translated into the BJP aggressively co-opting individuals and units of other parties to strengthen its leadership. From Rita Bahuguna Joshi in U.P. to Himanta Biswa Sarma in Assam, the BJP has taken in many rival leaders into its fold before elections. This resembles the strategy followed by the Congress in the 1970s, at the peak of Indira Gandhi   s rule. While in the short term, this strategy is giving the party immense electoral success and helping it expand its footprint, just as it had done for the Congress back then, in the medium to long term it poses grave risks. Many politicians and smaller parties have joined the BJP bandwagon as it looks the most lucrative option electorally, and they may desert it at next chance. In addition, as the BJP continues to bring into its fold leaders and parties from outside its ideological umbrella, it risks diluting the content of its ideology over time. If uninhibited, this could also lead to tensions between the BJP and the RSS.The BJP has undoubtedly replaced the Congress as the dominant national party and the cornerstone of India   s political and electoral system. This development has squeezed the space for centre-left forces in India   s polity and has given popular legitimacy to the centre-right narrative on issues of nationalism, secularism and social justice. As Yogendra Yadav has rightly pointed out, the centre-left needs a new vocabulary on the issue of social justice as the BJP has managed to convince a large section of society that the left   s language on the issue reeks of biases based on caste and religion.However, in order for the BJP to remain the dominant national party for a sustained period of time, it too needs to introspect to ensure it isn   t compromising long-term success for short-term rewards. Going forward, it should continue to widen its social base while ensuring it doesn   t lose its ideological identity. Otherwise, it will only remain dominant as long as a Mr. Modi remains at the helm. As when individuals acquire larger salience over ideology and organisation in parties, it leads to their decline down the road. That is exactly what happened to the Congress.Pradeep Chhibber and Rahul Verma are with the University of California, Berkeley.

BJP workers celebrate in Varanasi, U.P., the party's win in the Assembly election.PTIWe   d be lying if we said we saw this coming. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies won 325 out of 403 seats in the 2017 U.P. Assembly election, a strike rate of 81%. This is the largest number of seats won by any party/coalition in U.P. since the Janata Party in 1977. In retrospect, the analysis of this extraordinary feat is remarkably straightforward. It is almost a repeat of the national election in 2014, when U.P. was in the grip of the    Modi wave   .The aggregate vote share of BJP and its allies was 41.4% in this election, a hair less than the 43.6% it received in 2014. Even their performance over the seven phases of this election closely mirrors their performance in 2014. They had a strike rate of 90% in phase 1 (93% in 2014), 75% in phase 2 (73%), 80% in phase 3 (75%), 83% in phase 4 (77%), 85% in phase 5 (85%), 67% in phase 6 (88%), and 80% in phase 7 (100%). Curiously, the BJP and its allies only slipped, in comparison to their gaudy 2014 performance, in the final two phases of the election where Yogi Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself were expected to deliver sweeps for their party.Of course, the BJP   s Hindutva strategy and the Prime Minister   s popularity are a large part of the story here. But Mr. Modi   s popularity was present in Bihar and Delhi as well, even though the BJP got routed in those elections. The real question is: why was the BJP so successful in U.P. as opposed to, say, Bihar?The winning narrativeIt goes without saying that the electorate was most convinced by what the BJP had to offer. As a young man from the Rajbhar community outside Babina told us,    We need someone like Narendra Modi, who is with all castes.    The popular view of BJP in our travels was that of a caste-blind party, unlike the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) or the Samajwadi Party (SP), which are each broadly associated with one caste group (Jatavs or Yadavs). The form of particularistic politics associated with the BSP and SP left a large swathe of the population disaffected and without a (political) home. The newest avatar of the BJP, in which it has sought to distance itself from purely upper-caste politics, was able to consolidate and mobilise these groups against both the BSP and the SP.In the three previous State elections since 2000, the aggregate vote share of the four major parties     BJP, SP, BSP, and Congress     along with their allies, never rose above 84%. This means that in the State election, a significant proportion of voters (almost one in six) felt so unattached to the major players that they voted for independent candidates or small parties. In this election, 91.6% of all voters voted for one of the four major parties and their allies, most of this new vote likely going to the BJP (much like 2014 where the aggregate vote share was 93.2%). In short, the BJP effectively cannibalised the vote of the independent candidates and unaligned parties that were drawing voters who felt unattached to any of the major players. Five years ago, a 29.1% vote share was enough to give the SP a majority (224 out of 403) of seats; this time, the 28% vote share of the SP-Congress alliance was only good enough for 54 seats. The BJP has raised the bar; the particularistic politics of the past     and the vote shares associated with it     is unlikely to suffice in the future.Critics point to the role of religious polarisation in increasing vote share for the BJP and its allies; this is something that can be checked empirically. If results are driven by religious polarisation, the strike rate and the vote share of the BJP and its allies should be particularly large when the Muslim population is large (but not a majority), as Hindus rally against the Muslim community. In the 38 Assembly constituencies in districts that had at least 40% Muslim population, but not a majority, the strike rate for BJP and its allies dropped to 69% from 81% across U.P. Similarly, their average vote share in these constituencies dropped to 37.8% from 41.3% across U.P. Note further that the average Muslim population here is greater than the BJP   s vote share. Either the Muslim community is not as strategic as it is purported to be in keeping the BJP out of power, or some proportion of Muslims voted for the BJP this time. In short, while religious polarisation is certainly part of the BJP   s appeal, simplistic notions of polarisation or strategic voting by Muslims do not explain the results in the election. Rather, this election should be understood in terms of caste consolidation against particularistic politics.A new politics in U.P.Unlike Bihar, where Nitish Kumar was seen as more than just a leader of the Kurmi community, Akhilesh Yadav could never distance himself from the burden of local Yadav domination across U.P. Thus, the BJP   s caste consolidation largely failed in Bihar while producing a sweep in U.P. The SP   s alliance with the Congress never worked well either. There were 22    friendly fights    in which both parties put up candidates in the same constituency. While the SP had a poor strike rate of 15% on an average vote share of 28.4% in seats contested, even these votes didn   t transfer to the Congress. The Congress    strike rate was just 6% on an average vote share of 22.6% in seats contested. Mayawati   s BSP had a strike rate of just 5% and an average vote share of 22.2% in seats contested. No doubt each of these parties will have to reinvent itself and move beyond the particularistic politics with which it is associated if it wants to survive.Given the scale of this victory for the BJP, this is almost certainly the beginning of a new chapter in the storied history of the politics of Uttar Pradesh.Neelanjan Sircar, Bhanu Joshi and Ashish Ranjan are affiliated with the Centre for Policy Research in Delhi",opinion,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/competing-to-make-up-the-numbers/article17459218.ece,"Pradip PhanjoubamTrue to forecasts of what might happen in the event of a split verdict for the 11th Manipur Legislative Assembly, the advantage seems now to be with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Although the last word is still to be said, the BJP, using its clout as the party in power at the Centre, has managed to cobble together a slim majority even though it won less seats than the Congress. In an informal show of strength, the party   s representatives met State Governor Najma Heptulla and claimed the support of 32 MLAs, with a rider that more would be joining its camp     a hint that it would split the Congress and absorb a part of it.The fluid situation has come about because in the House of 60, the Congress won 28 seats, just three short to return to power for a record fourth term, while the BJP could manage 21 seats, 10 short of the magic number.Of the remaining 11, four were won by the National People   s Party (NPP), founded by the former Lok Sabha Speaker from Meghalaya, Purno A. Sangma, and now led by his politician son Conrad Sangma, four by the Nagaland-based Naga People   s Front (NPF), one each by Ram Vilas Paswan   s Lok Janshakti Party, Mamata Banerjee   s Trinamool Congress, and an independent candidate.By constitutional norms, the Governor would most likely invite the single largest party, the Congress, first to prove its majority. It should have been relatively easy for the Congress to get three more supporters to qualify to form the government, but there is more to this mixed mandate than meets the eye.Wheels within wheelsThe NPF, which won its four seats on the campaign plank of carving out Naga-dominated areas of Manipur to become part of a Greater Nagaland, would not support the Congress which has been vehemently opposed to the idea. The LJP is an ally of the BJP at the Centre. This leaves the NPP, Trinamool Congress and the independent candidate, six MLAs in all, for the Congress to look for support.However, there is a hitch. Under the stewardship of Assam Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, a former Congress leader who defected to the BJP to ultimately play an important role in pulling down the Tarun Gogoi government in the 2016 Assam Assembly elections, a group called the North-East Democratic Alliance had been formed last year which pledges allegiance to the NDA government. The NPP is a part of this group.The question was: Would the Manipur unit of this Meghalaya party feel obligated enough to honour this pledge in seeking alliances to form the government in the State? It seems the BJP has managed to convince the party they should. The Congress had the Trinamool which is opposed to the BJP and the independent MLAs to win over, but here too the BJP seems to have sabotaged the prospect. The independent MLA, from the Jiribam constituency on the Assam border, was reportedly abducted by the BJP from Imphal airport after he arrived with a Congress leader. The Trinamool MLA too has reportedly decided to join the BJP. However, even if the Congress got their support, the coalition   s number would be 30, leaving the Assembly in a hopeless tie.The Congress may be trying to strike a deal with the NPP as a signed letter of support by the NPP produced by the Congress does suggest it did intend to go with the Congress. The NPP is new as it is, but very new in Manipur. Most of its leaders are disgruntled politicians from other established parties.Speed bumps aheadEven if a BJP-led coalition does become a reality, it will not be without problems. The NPF has agreed to support the BJP but could also withdraw support if and when the question of a Greater Nagaland returns to the fore. It is also a foregone conclusion that such a scenario would come about sooner than later in the backdrop of the much-hyped but little known Framework Agreement being negotiated between the Union government and the Naga militant organisation, the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah). This is especially so as Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself pledged during the election campaign that no agreement with the NSCN(IM) would be allowed to affect Manipur territory. Probably this is also why the BJP is looking to splinter and absorb a portion of the Congress so that if it does form the next government, it will not be left at the mercy of the NPF.Again, under the anti-defection law, there is a ceiling on the size of State cabinets. For Manipur this is 12 including the Chief Minister, and accommodating party hopefuls and allies alike will be tough. Therefore, plenty of loyalty auctions, hopefully not too ugly, are to be expected in the next few days before a government is formed.Since the Congress can only make the majority mark with the NPP support, and the BJP keen to prevent this from happening, the NPP   s price tags as kingmakers would have already soared.Pradip Phanjoubam is editor, Imphal Free Press and author,    The Northeast Question: Conflicts and frontiers",opinion,,

Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs to challenge long-established convictions on whether the elements of power in the next world order will revolve around diplomacy, force, or trade as the primary tool.Moving to a multipolar worldIn the last 20 years, incomes of 80% of the population in the West stagnated while per capita income in China quadrupled, and India   s more than doubled. Society is ageing; technology is disrupting labour markets and business models. The digital economy is expected to provide one-quarter of global productivity by 2025 and will have the U.S., China and India reinforcing the multipolar order.The functioning of the global economy has affected the economic and political relationship between the large and small economies, reducing and increasing the leverage exercised by the U.S. and China, respectively. The China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which former U.S. President Barack Obama failed to weaken, and the New Development Bank of the BRICS could provide the required $8-15 trillion, marginalising the World Bank. China is projecting the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative as a replacement for the U.S.-led post-1950 multilateral institutions.Mr. Trump is understandably questioning the relevance of the United Nations for the U.S., favouring bilateral deals and forcing others to rethink the nature and role of international cooperation. He is resetting priorities away from peacekeeping, environment and human rights to trade.His    America First    strategy has broad support within the U.S. Other rich countries like Japan and the U.K. are likely to adopt this new template doing away with concessions to others. There will be consequences for the World Trade Organisation, in particular if the WTO dispute resolution panels rule against the U.S., leading to a questioning of the rule-based system itself.Mr. Trump recognises that he cannot stop global trends and the diminishing returns from a reliance on diplomacy and force, exemplified by the failure of the U.S.    pivot    in containing China. Mr. Obama   s response to the entry of three billion Asians into the global economy was to attempt setting new trade rules outside the WTO. Mr. Trump has rejected this approach, favouring an employment-oriented deal around specific sectors much like the Obama-Xi understanding on climate change. The difference is that Mr. Trump is prepared to limit imports and boost exports even at the cost of upsetting long-standing agreements and allies.Mr. Trump is    willing to find new friends and to forge new partnerships where shared interests align   , rejecting the Cold War logic of containment, reliance on foreign bases and alliances. He sees China as the greatest threat, as the combination of military and economic strength creates a strategic situation where, like in the Cold War, the U.S. will need to seek a    constructive relationship    in Asia rather than dominance and may join the OBOR.Asian connectivity and IndiaMr. Trump is moving for a political deal with Russia and a trade deal with China. Chinese exports to the U.S. are already declining, the shift to a consumption-driven economy will open markets for U.S. goods, and the RMB is now a global reserve currency. India is more vulnerable with two-thirds of the exports of the $150-billion IT industry to the U.S. and the    Make in India    strategy colliding with Mr. Trump   s priorities, requiring India to make strategic choices.As the multilateral order fragments into spheres of influence, we first need a bold vision on Kashmir and must not just seek to isolate Pakistan. We should join the OBOR, while maintaining our reservations on its branch passing through Kashmir, and become part of the growing Asian market.The nature of conflict is changing from direct clashes to disruption of critical infrastructure through remote attacks. With world-class cyber-space-biotech capability, we should reconsider large-scale purchases from abroad for massive investment in cybersecurity and the related digital economy that will make the    Digital India    initiative into a    Digital Asia    one.India expects nothing less from Mr. Modi.Mukul Sanwal is a former UN diplomat and currently Visiting Professor at the Tsinghua University, Beijing, China",opinion,,

This verdict by South Korea   s highest court, upholding Parliament   s vote to impeach Park Geun-hye, could well herald a new era in a land where it has for long been unthinkable to get the powerful to face justice even for serious crimes. Significantly, Parliament   s move in December to unseat Ms. Park by an overwhelming vote had been backed even by legislators from her conservative Saenuri party. Stripped of presidential immunity, Ms. Park could now face criminal proceedings on allegations that she was complicit in nefarious activities involving her close confidante. The chief accusation is that they solicited contributions to promote dodgy non-profit organisations in return for clearing questionable corporate deals. The protests last year by hundreds of thousands who sought action in the influence-peddling scandal, as well as violent clashes that followed Friday   s judicial verdict, are an indication of how polarising a figure Ms. Park has been through her tenure since 2013. Her autocratic and whimsical rule was marked by fierce attacks on labour unions, smear campaigns against critics, and efforts to rewrite history textbooks. The most provocative foreign policy move was the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence, an American missile defence system, escalating regional tensions. China retaliated with calls for the boycott of South Korean imports.The divisions among her followers and detractors are as much ideological as they are intergenerational. A number of Ms. Park   s party supporters continue to harbour sympathies for the daughter of South Korea   s moderniser, the military dictator Park Chung-hee. But younger generations see the severing of all links with this authoritarian past as a necessary guarantee for the consolidation of democracy, three decades after return to civilian rule. The chaebols     South Korea   s highly influential family-owned conglomerates     may have had economic motivations to lean heavily on political patronage during the country   s industrial ascendency and integration into the global market. But such cosy arrangements are proving to be untenable when exceptions of the past are sought to be institutionalised. The task of public cleansing in South Korea is far from over, as is evident from the ongoing criminal proceedings involving tycoons from its best-known corporations. The recent assertion of the independence of the judiciary from political interference and the capacity of legislators to uphold their authority are notable. It would be no surprise, therefore, if South Korea   s example becomes a model worthy of emulation elsewhere in the region.

As the State went to the polls, there was a clutch of arguments marshalled by sundry political commentators on why the BJP could not repeat its huge sweep in the 2014 Lok Sabha election     the magnitude of which had surprised the party itself as much as its rivals. It was pointed out, for instance, that this was a State election, the implication being that a totally different political dynamic would be at play. Other factors such as the effect of demonetisation, the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance, and the fading appeal of Prime Minister Narendra Modi were thrown into the mix. As it turned out, none of this seemed to matter much as the results of the two elections were eerily similar     both in terms of the geographical spread of the victory and vote percentages. The BJP managed to effectively tap into segments among the Other Backward Classes and Dalits, besides its upper-caste vote base. The popularity of Mr. Modi contributed in no small measure to the election result, but the party succeeded by also feeding into the disgruntlement over the narrow social alliances forged by the SP and the BSP.The SP and the BSP, following their 2014 debacle, chose to make two tactical changes. By revolting against his father and party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, incumbent Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav presented himself and his party as agents of development. But he was unable to convince the electorate that the party had moved away from caste and, more specifically, Yadav-led patronage. Despite the alliance with a weak Congress party, the SP   s support remained limited to its core traditional vote. The BSP tried a newer tactic, an abstract Dalit-Muslim alliance, and ran on the hope that fielding candidates based on identity would break the coalition of forces that had supported the BJP in 2014. But the expediency of this strategy based on caste and community failed, partly because of perceptions that BSP leader Mayawati was ambivalent about who she would join hands with in the event of a hung Assembly. U.P. is a communally sensitive State and the BJP     which failed to field a single Muslim candidate     must not interpret the scale of the victory as an endorsement of majoritarianism or an excuse to raise the political pitch on divisive issues such as the Ram temple in Ayodhya. Going into the 2019 general election, Mr. Modi and his party will be closely monitored on how much they adhere to his promise of taking everyone along.

Should the government intervene? But before we ask that, does it make sense to ban cab aggregators?Uber and Ola, the top players in India, have about 32,000 cabs plying in Chennai, according to a union member who participated in the recent drivers    strike. Assuming a low average of six trips a day, as not all cabs ply daily, the city   s commuters make close to 2 lakh trips a day with them. Given the kind of presence cab operators have across the country     Uber has about 2.4 lakh drivers at any point     it may not be a great idea to ban such services.Should the government then regulate prices so that drivers earn better? Protesting driver unions in Chennai have demanded that the government fix a minimum of Rs. 100 for the first 4 km in a standard ride.However, if two competing ride services help bring prices down for the commuter, why meddle with that model? Yes, for drivers who have spent savings or taken loans to buy a new car hoping that earnings will remain high, it is a let-down.   This is business   One argument in favour of the drivers is that they may not be informed enough that the terms of business constantly change. Signing up with cab aggregators means entering a business partnership. The drivers bought, and continue to buy, new vehicles even as the terms of engagement have been changing over the last few months. For drivers across operators, the terms have changed from a minimum number of trips per day to a minimum fare amount per day and now operators have fixed a certain number of trips a week for drivers to enjoy incentives or    boosts   . One Uber driver said:    This is business. No one is forcing me to drive. If I don   t, someone else will.   In an ideal world, the cab aggregator would ensure that everyone got a good deal. But if that does not happen, the government has no business intervening as long as players act within the limits of law.After all, regulators don   t prevent a player from reducing prices just to protect revenues of other players. However, when service providers collude to fix prices above competitive levels, thus harming the consumer, the government should step in to break the cartel.Otherwise, let the market decide. If Ola does not change its terms of engagement with drivers, Uber may lure drivers away with better terms. If Uber refuses to drop its commission for every trip, as drivers now demand of it, its drivers may leave.On the flip side, even if commuter prices in a competitive environment charged by cab operators go up to astronomical levels, the government should not enter the picture.

http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/controlling-hivlike-virus-in-monkeys/article17459229.ece,"In an interesting study, the immune system of monkeys was found capable of controlling HIV-like virus (Simian-Human Immunodeficiency Virus or SHIV) when treatment with a combination of two anti-HIV antibodies was started three days after infection. The immune system of the animals was found to control the virus even after the anti-HIV antibodies were no longer present in the monkeys.In a paper titled    Early antibody therapy can induce long-lasting immunity to SHIV    published on March 13 in the journal Nature , researchers from the National Institutes of Health and other institutes infected 13 macaque monkeys with the SHIV virus. Unlike earlier studies where intervention began late, the researchers started treating the monkeys with two broadly neutralising HIV antibodies from the third day of infection. The monkeys were infused with the two drugs three times over a two-week period.Compared with controls, six monkeys were able to suppress the virus for 56 days to even six months; in one monkey, the virus was below detectable level for 150 days. Once the antibodies level dropped to a    very low    in the animals, the virus resurfaced. The time taken to rebound was directly related to the concentration of the neutralising antibodies in the plasma.Five to 22 months after the virus resurfaced, the immune system of the six monkeys spontaneously regained control of the virus and brought it down to undetectable levels for another five to 13 months. Four other monkeys could never fully regain complete control of the virus, but the viral load was at a    very low level    for more than two years. Of the 13 monkeys studied, 10 were able to benefit from two neutralising antibodies administered. A particular kind of immune cells called CD8+ T cells were found to be higher in all the animals that were infected with the SHIV virus. To ascertain if CD8+ T cells were responsible for mediating sustained suppression of virus replication, the researchers purposely depleted the CD8+ T cells in the six monkeys. What followed was a sharp increase in the viral load in all the animals. This helped the researchers conclude that the CD8+ T cells controlled the virus multiplication following administration of the neutralising antibodies.Though SHIV infection in macaque monkeys differs from HIV-1 infection in humans, the researchers suggest that immunotherapy should be explored to control the spread of virus, contain the damage to CD8+ T cells, mobilise a robust immune response, and control HIV infection in humans.",opinion,,

A lack of accessibility to effective digital infrastructure and computing abilities is what poses a major impediment in creating a Digital India (   On computing ability, rural India lost in the woods   , March 15). Most rural schools do not teach computer education in the curriculum. It is time the government made basic computer education mandatory and provided a computer in every village school. Even though the penetration of smartphones is on the rise, most people are still ignorant about the use of digital transactions and e-governance in rural as well as urban India. The programme to provide all gram panchayats with optical fibre connections still remains a pipe dream. In short, Digital India cannot become a reality without providing digital facilities and enabling e-literacy in every village.Gagan Pratap Singh,Noida, Uttar PradeshThe use of a personal computer, irrespective of it being in a rural or urban setting, primarily depends on one   s interest and attitude and is not related to the knowledge or capability of a user. Another reason for low digitalisation is that most Indians are habituated to interacting with people rather than machines, which is in complete contrast to what it is in the West.Kshirasagara Balaji Rao,HyderabadVaccine misconceptionsSoon after the measles rubella vaccination campaign was announced by the government, strange messages began to be circulated on social media. I found most of them to be baffling given my background     I am an intern from a medical college in Mangaluru who was sent to a few schools on the outskirts of the city to educate parents about MR. For instance, we walked into a classroom to tell parents all they needed to know but found that those in the room had already made up their minds about what to tell us. They saw us as agents of the government trying to reduce the population in the name of an MR campaign. In the end, we could convince a few parents about the need to vaccinate their children.There are no side effects, but a few may develop fever which is self-limiting. For the MR vaccine campaign to be a success, we need to communicate the right message.Prasanth G. NarahariAttavar, MangaluruPrejudice and learningThere is an urgent need to enlist experts to revamp the existing education system (   JNU student from TN ends life   , March 14). The system is impoverished and cannot ensure the holistic development of children, which leaves especially students from an underprivileged background vulnerable. Children with educated parents generally have a robust internal defence mechanism and learn to weather the inadequacies embedded in the system. Children who do not inherit such a mechanism fall prey to various maladies.Nagarajamani M.V.,HyderabadMaternity benefitsThe Central government   s decision to increase paid maternity leave for women in the organised sector to 26 weeks is a progressive step (Editorial        Partial cover   , March 11).In this connection, one must note that the World Health Organisation had also recommended exclusive breastfeeding of children for the first 24 weeks.The move should be expanded to the unorganised sectors as a majority of the working women force is here. Besides maternity leave, mothers need nutritious food and medical facilities, either free or at subsided rates. The government should ensure these.Bobbili Sridhara Rao,HyderabadI would also suggest that facilities to enhance opportunities for self-employment through household industries such as easy credit, free skill training in the making of marketable products and services, help in acquiring mobility through the use of cycles or scooters and baby care centres near their homes would help marginalised women retain their jobs after childbirth. Women labourers in the unorganised sector already face obstacles in the form of discriminatory wages, lack of job security and denial of government facilities. Hence, if the government resorts to inclusiveness in rendering labour rights to these women workers, they would continue to contribute to GNP.Rameeza A. Rasheed,Chennai",opinion,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/saffron-storm-in-uttar-pradesh/article17469382.ece,"zoya hasanThe big verdict in the big State is out. It highlights several important trends, which though specific to Uttar Pradesh, have implications far beyond it. The spectacular political triumph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is the strongest evidence yet of the tectonic shift in progress since the 2014 Lok Sabha election; to all intents and purposes, the BJP   s resurgence in U.P. consolidates the rightward shift in Indian politics and alters the balance of power to its advantage ahead of the 2019 general election.Nationalisation of electionsAt a broader level, the historic outcome represents the nationalisation of State elections which is a key element of the BJP   s strategy to establish its electoral dominance across the country. The similarity in the national and State election outcomes indicates the re-nationalisation of elections. What underpins nationalisation? Mr. Modi was front and centre in the campaign; thanks to him, the party won a massive majority in a State election without a local face. People voted for Mr. Modi in the State election as though they were voting in a general election. This knocked out the earlier trend of regionalisation when people voted in the general election as though they were voting in State elections.Also, people voted for Mr. Modi even though he has not done much to deliver on the promises of development, and moreover has not done much for U.P. But the public dissatisfaction with the incumbent State government was enough to persuade voters to believe the Prime Minister   s promise of development rather than either of the two State-based alternatives on offer. Polarisation was actively fuelled by communal appeals, with Mr. Modi taking the lead in stoking the feeling of discrimination against Hindus, pushing in the process a shift towards majoritarian consolidation. The election campaign which started on the high note of development then began to traverse the proverbial ground of polarisation. Not a single Muslim was given a BJP ticket. This sent a clear message that the BJP would not    appease minorities   , and that Muslims would be shown their place. Muslims have indeed been shown their place in this election.As in 2014, it was not overt communalism or straightforward development rhetoric; it was a heady cocktail of both elements couched within a discourse of    communalised development   . This mix was dressed up in the political language of    nationalism    which appeals to large parts of U.P.   s electorate. The secular parties were unable to offer an effective counter-narrative to this discourse.In a surcharged political climate, the critical issue is not the project of    development for all   , but the prospect of development for certain groups cleverly articulated in the rhetoric of discrimination against none. The odious communal reference to graveyards and crematoriums in Mr. Modi   s Fatehpur speech repeated by BJP president Amit Shah immediately afterwards and laced with    KASAB    left no scope for misunderstanding which way the politics of development was going. The mordant discourse split U.P., which was once defined by cultural syncretism and Ganga-Jumni culture, along Hindu-Muslim lines.Marginalising MuslimsIn the event, many voters were willing to buy into the BJP   s charges of minority appeasement. Muslims, on the other hand, were expected to vote en masse for the Samajwadi Party (SP)-Congress alliance in order to check the BJP   s advance but it seems this didn   t quite happen because many Muslims reportedly voted for the Bahujan Samaj Party. Nonetheless, the prospect of Muslim consolidation behind the SP was used as a rallying cry for the polarisation of Hindu votes.While the BJP leadership was propagating its mantra of    development for all   , it lost no opportunity to indulge in    community-oriented developmentalism    of its own. It repeatedly attacked the SP government for discriminating between Hindus and Muslims even at the level of providing basic facilities like electricity. The SP government released detailed data of electricity provisions during Eid and Diwali festivals, but it certainly didn   t stop the BJP from continuing to make wild charges of discrimination and giving the impression that it is the only party to challenge the patronage system practised by the SP and Congress. Undeterred by facts, it went on to complain that Muslims were the only ones to benefit from the Kanya Vidya Dhan Yojana, under which the U.P. government provides assistance of Rs. 30,000 to each girl student who has passed the 12th board examinations with distinction. It is evident that post-truth is having a field day in U.P. A blithe disregard for facts characterised the political campaign of the BJP in this election.U.P. has been the epicentre of identity politics for over two decades but this election exposed the limits of the politics of social justice. The OBC and Dalit movement, which started off as a political voice of the marginalised social groups giving them a sense of participation in political affairs, had been reduced to the politics of reservations with benefits cornered by particular segments of these castes which alienated sub-groups within the wider category. The BJP was quick to take advantage of the discontent of large social segments with old style identity politics. Turning the politics of social justice on its head, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)/BJP crafted a broad-based identity politics on the ruins of the old political order which had outlived its utility for a critical mass of OBCs. It mobilised a new bloc of voters by showering attention on the most backward among them     the non-Yadav OBCs and non-Jatav Dalits     that blunted the politics of BSP and SP in one stroke. The terms of engagement were unmistakably driven by identity and motivated by resentment towards Yadav-Muslim domination under SP rule. The BJP   s idea of community politics gained new traction as a large number of Hindu voters saw it as a more capacious identity which aligns them to a larger narrative than the fragmentation inherent in caste politics.The strategy of reverse social engineering that Mr. Shah scripted was clearly aimed at mobilising the most backward castes, notably non-Yadav OBCs and non-Jatav Dalits, to capture the heartland State. In pursuit of this agenda, he distributed tickets copiously to non-Yadav OBCs and to non-Jatavs in reserved seats. Mr. Modi   s assiduous wooing of non-Yadav OBCs and Dalits convinced large sections of them to desert the SP and BSP in the 2014 Lok Sabha election and again in the 2017 Assembly elections.The power of propagandaFinally, the stunning victory emphasises the importance of propaganda and messaging. No one can match up to the appeal and the energy of Mr. Modi when it comes to non-stop election campaigning, and the organisational capacity of the RSS when it comes to relentless propaganda and booth management executed in this election by 1.4 lakh booth samitis. Demonetisation is a good illustration of the power of propaganda. Voters in U.P. seem to connect to Mr. Modi   s political messaging and were more than willing to forgive the hardships inflicted on them by notebandi .In the end, a fractured opposition too helped the BJP. In a three-cornered contest, the BJP had a strong advantage. The party   s vote share jumped from just 15% in 2012 to 39.6% in 2017, which was large enough to win more than a three-fourths majority against a divided opposition. The combined vote share of the BSP (22.2%) and the SP-Congress alliance (28.2%) adds up to over 50%. The Opposition   s only hope of taking on Mr. Modi and the ruling party is to unite on a common platform and ensure that the vote is not split since 50% of voters have not been swayed by BJP   s ideology of    communalised development   , which is an essential part of its growth strategy.Zoya Hasan is Professor Emerita, Centre for Political Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University and Distinguished Professor, Council for Social Development, New Delhi",opinion,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/an-exit-from-brexit/article17469391.ece,"vidya ramIn early March, British Prime Minister Theresa May took to the stage in Glasgow to address a gathering of Scottish Conservatives as talk of a potential second Scottish referendum gathered pace. Mrs. May adopted a strategy of attack: lambasting the Scottish National Party (SNP) for    tunnel vision nationalism   , including in its approach to the EU referendum.The SNP had been highlighting the significance of retaining single market access to the EU, but this, she said, clouded the fact that the U.K. domestic market was worth    four times more to Scottish firms    than Europe. She then pointed to an example of what she believed could be achieved outside the EU. She noted that Scottish whisky represented just a 1% share of the Indian market, thanks to a tariff of 150%.    I am determined we should do better than that for our key industries,    she said.    That   s why I led a major trade delegation to India last year, and why I was delighted to take the Scottish Whisky Association with me.   That speech     delivered just over a week before Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon   s momentous announcement that she would be seeking Scottish parliamentary approval for a second referendum on independence     highlighted one of the challenges facing Scotland, which will have to weigh up EU and U.K. membership should a new referendum on independence go ahead.More about market accessWhile Scotland voted decisively in favour of remaining in the EU (62% of Scots voted to remain, against 55.8% of Northern Ireland, 47.5% of Wales, and 46.6% of England), Brexit was as divisive of the    yes    and    no    camps of the 2014 Scottish referendum as it was of communities across the U.K., says John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde and a noted pollster.   Although a lot of people may have voted to remain in the EU, they weren   t doing so with an enormous enthusiasm that says we must stay above everything else,    he adds. It   s one reason why even after the Brexit referendum took place last year, opinion on independence didn   t change dramatically from where it was in 2014, when just over 55% of the population said they wanted to remain within the U.K. in the independence referendum.Could that be about to change? Recent polls have suggested a rise in support for independence (to around 50%), perhaps spurred by the announcement of the U.K. government earlier this year that it would have no alternative but to leave the single market and the customs union     seen as a kick in the teeth by the Scottish government which in December published a White Paper setting out the case why it was essential for Scotland to retain unfettered access to it. Dubbing the Westminster government   s unwillingness to engage on this issue as a    brick wall of intransigence   , Ms. Sturgeon this week set out the case for a second referendum.Her focus on the single market     rather than E.U. membership     is perhaps indicative of her awareness that it is the risk of losing this rather than full-blown membership that is likely to rile voters.Exactly what question voters could face in a second referendum on independence remains to be seen. Ms. Sturgeon believes a referendum between autumn next year and spring 2019 would be ideal: by this stage the shape of the Brexit negotiations is likely to be somewhat clearer, enabling voters to make a more informed choice. While the U.K. government has the power to block the referendum from happening under current legislation, whether it would take the highly controversial step of doing so (particularly at a time it has emphasised taking back control and parliamentary sovereignty) remains to be seen. It is thought more likely that it could push to hold the referendum after Britain leaves the EU, though Ms. Sturgeon has warned that this would be akin to puncturing a lifeboat after sinking the ship.    I was elected as [First Minister] on a clear manifesto commitment   the [Prime Minister] is not yet elected by anyone,    she noted in a tweet earlier this week.The factors at playThe biggest question going forward will be public appetite for independence. Downing Street has insisted that it does not exist, and there are certainly factors that may make Scots cautious about leaving the union, such as the impact of the low oil price environment on the Scottish economy. Leaving the union and joining the EU would also be a logistical nightmare, calling the current open border between England and Scotland into question. The Westminster government is likely to play on those concerns as well as highlight the potential for industries such as the Scottish drinks industry within a U.K. unshackled by EU membership, with links to fast-growing Commonwealth countries, and beyond.However, winning that argument may prove tricky, given the already existing concerns about the future of sectors such as banking in a Britain outside the EU. An independence campaign is likely to emphasise the opportunities that remaining within the single market could have to attract investment from the financial services sector, among others.There are other factors at play too: while all political parties in Westminster threw themselves into the    no    campaign in 2014, their ability to do so is likely to be more constrained this time round, particularly if Brexit negotiations are under way. Also given the electoral impact in 2014 for Labour of sharing a platform with the Conservatives (essentially electoral oblivion in Scotland), it is questionable whether they would do so again, particularly under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn.According to Nighet Riaz, who headed    Scots Asians for Yes to an Independent Scotland    during the first referendum campaign and is currently standing for election as a councillor in Pollokshields, one of the most ethnically diverse wards of Glasgow, while opinion on the EU referendum was mixed within the local community, there is a real concern about the future.    On the doorstep, we are hearing people asking,    What does Brexit mean for us, our jobs, our mortgages, and our day-to-day living?       She believes the campaign for a second referendum is likely to gather momentum.    Everything we were promised [in the first referendum] did not materialise: we were told we would be listened to, we were an important part of the union, but we have been disregarded and ridiculed on the same lines as before and during the referendum    we voted against Brexit and we are now getting dragged out of the single market.   vidya.ram@thehindu.co.in",opinion,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/crimes-of-apartheid/article17469384.ece,"vijay prashadApartheid is a powerful word, and the United Nations does not use it loosely. But now, in a report released on March 15 in Beirut, Lebanon, the UN has proclaimed that Israel    is guilty of the crime of apartheid   . This is a very significant judgment, one with important ramifications for the UN, for the International Court of Justice and for the international community.In 2015, the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) was charged by its member-states to study whether Israel has established an apartheid regime. ESCWA asked two American academics     Richard Falk and Virginia Tilley     to undertake the study. The report that they have now produced makes the    grave charge    that Israel is guilty of apartheid not only in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem     the Occupied Territory     but also within its own boundaries and against the Palestinian refugees.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington, DC recently to meet U.S. President Donald Trump. At that meeting, Mr. Trump seemed to disregard the international consensus towards the creation of two states. In fact, as this report and others show, the two-state solution has been long vitiated. The Israeli government   s illegal Jewish settlement project in the West Bank and its virtual annexation of East Jerusalem makes it impossible to imagine the establishment of Palestine in that region. What exists is one state with an apartheid system, with Israeli Jews in a dominant position over the Palestinians. The new UN report speaks to this disturbing apartheid situation not only in the Occupied Territory of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, but in all of Israel.A    demographic threat   One reason why the Israeli government is unwilling to consider a one-state solution with equal rights for all Israelis and Palestinians is what they call a    demographic threat   . If the 12 million Palestinians     exiles and refugees included     would be citizens of this one state, then they would dwarf the six million Jews in the country. The UN report argues that Israel is a    racial regime    because its institutions are premised on maintaining a Jewish nation by techniques of suppression and expulsion.Palestinians who have Israeli citizenship (ezrahut) do not have the right to nationality (le   um), which means that they can only access inferior social services, face restrictive zoning laws, and find themselves unable to freely buy land. All Palestinians     whether those who live in Haifa (Israel) or in Ain al-Hilweh (Lebanon)     suffer the consequences of Israeli apartheid. This indignity is punctuated with laws that humiliate the Palestinians. The latest law     the Muezzin Bill     imposes limits on the Muslim call to prayer in Israel and East Jerusalem.Matters would be less grave if the Israeli political system allowed Palestinians rights to make their case against apartheid-like conditions. Article 7(a) of the Basic Law prohibits any political party from considering a challenge to the state   s Jewish character. Since this description of the Israeli state renders Palestinians as second-class citizens, their voting rights are reduced to merely an affirmation of their subordination.Since most of the world   s states have signed the Convention Against Apartheid, they are now obliged to act to punish instances of apartheid. Two recommendations from the report stand out. First, the authors ask that the International Criminal Court (ICC) investigate the situation in Israel. The ICC   s Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda opened an investigation on Israel   s 2014 bombing of Gaza and on the illegal settlements in the West Bank. Second, the report asks that member states allow    criminal prosecutions of Israeli officials demonstrably connected with the practices of apartheid against the Palestinian people   .When the UN Security Council declared late last year that Israel   s settlements in the Occupied Territory were illegal, there was worry in Israel that Ms. Bensouda would accelerate her work. Others in Israel said that there was nothing new in the resolution, which neither used the word    grave    to describe the situation nor considered Israeli actions to be a war crime. But the new report does both. If it is acknowledged that Israel is an apartheid state, then this is tantamount to war crime (in the 1977 Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions) and to a crime against humanity (in the 1973 Apartheid Convention and the 1998 Rome Statute of the ICC).India   s reactionTo prepare the ground for Prime Minister Narendra Modi   s trip to Israel later this year, Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar will soon go to Israel. Word comes from the Ministry of External Affairs that it is likely that Mr. Modi will not visit the Occupied Territory, which will be a snub to Palestine. India   s overall reaction to this report will define Mr. Modi   s attitude towards Israel. The appearance of this report     and its strong conclusions     should give Mr. Modi pause before he shreds decades of consensus for Palestine from India.Vijay Prashad, Professor of International Studies at Trinity College, is the author of    The Death of the Nation and the Future of the Arab Revolution",opinion,,

And so it did not come as too much of a surprise when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) romped home with the highest margin since the formation of the State 17 years ago. Riding on the Modi wave, it bagged 57 of the 70 Assembly seats in the State, with the Congress winning just 11. Mr. Rawat, who waged a lonely battle for his party, lost both the seats he contested. Even the president of the State unit of the party, Kishore Upadhyay, lost his election. A majority of Mr. Rawat   s Cabinet colleagues also bit the dust.Mr. Rawat had survived an attempt to topple his government last year after a section of Congress leaders joined hands with the opposition BJP. His government survived only after the intervention of the courts but it was clear that he had lost popular support. The Rawat government faced several allegations of corruption and maladministration. Even during the attempted coup led by some of his colleagues last year, a sting operation had allegedly exposed the Chief Minister himself offering to look the other way in exchange of support to him. The issue is now being investigated under a directive from the courts.Ploughing a lonely furrowHardly any senior Congress leader campaigned in Uttarakhand. Even party vice-president Rahul Gandhi addressed just a couple of election rallies, which too did not evoke much response. In an effort to woo the large number of youth in the State, Mr. Rawat announced an attractive but controversial    Berojgari bhatta    (unemployment allowance) card promising one job per household for those unemployed between the ages of 18 and 35, by 2020.The scheme also provided for a monthly allowance of Rs. 2,500 for one jobless member of each family for 36 months to all such card-holders.The Election Commission later directed the State authorities to stop the distribution of cards although over 10,000 people had registered within 48 hours of its launch.However, such last-hour promises failed to cut much ice with the electorate, which turned out in huge numbers at Prime Minister Narendra Modi   s three major public rallies in Uttarakhand. This, despite the fact that the State unit of the BJP was in bad shape and facing internal rebellion. In fact, State BJP president Ajay Bhatt eventually lost to his Congress rival by a margin of over 49,000 votes in Ranikhet.The rebellion within the State unit of the BJP resulted from the unsuccessful attempt last year to topple the Rawat government. The party had to accommodate all nine Congress rebel MLAs, including former Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna. Those denied the party ticket to make way for the Congress rebels joined the Congress. Interestingly, almost 80% of the constituencies in the State had rebels contesting against their party   s candidates.A targeted BJP campaignThe BJP had several factors going in its favour. It pitched its campaign to target the youth, who make up more than half the electorate. The party announced several schemes for them including unemployment allowance and creation of jobs. It also announced many developmental schemes for the State.Uttarakhand has the distinction of contributing a disproportionately large number of personnel to the defence forces and other paramilitary forces. It also has a large number of retired personnel from these forces settled in the State. The BJP   s campaign targeted the roughly 1.75 lakh such households, which makes up a substantial vote bank in the small hill State. The party pitched the successful surgical strikes and never failed to mention the contribution of the State towards the defence forces. The acceptance of the demand for    One Rank, One Pension    (OROP) also gained popular goodwill for the party.The performance of the BJP in Uttarakhand is likely to have an impact on the party   s fortunes in the neighbouring hill State of Himachal Pradesh where elections are due later this year.Vipin Pubby is a Chandigarh-based journalist",opinion,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/its-complicated/article17469379.ece,"Until Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan started a high-voltage campaign for next month   s referendum on constitutional reforms that give him more powers, relations between Ankara and the European Union were relatively stable, though not without glitches. Trouble started when Mr. Erdogan   s allies drew up plans to organise campaign rallies in European cities to mobilise support among the tens of thousands of Turks living in Europe who are eligible to vote in the April 16 referendum. Several European countries, including Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands, and some German towns, banned such rallies, raising security concerns as well as fear of domestic political repercussions. Mr. Erdogan, however, turned this into a Turkey versus West spat. When German towns blocked the rallies, Mr. Erdogan accused the country of    Nazi practices   . When the Netherlands refused landing rights to a plane carrying Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, who was on his way to address a referendum rally, Mr. Erdogan called the country    fascist    and    a Nazi remnant   . Ties between the Netherlands and Turkey deteriorated rapidly thereafter, with Ankara effectively removing the Dutch ambassador. The Turkish government has also hinted that it would scrap an agreement reached with Europe last year to curb the passage of migrants through Turkey in return for financial help from the EU.The referendum is crucial for Mr. Erdogan   s ambitious plans to overhaul Turkey   s political system. If he gets the reforms approved by a majority of voters, Turkey would move towards a presidential system. He would then handpick his own cabinet and his Justice and Development Party   s MPs and gain at least two five-year terms uncontested. It is therefore unsurprising that Mr. Erdogan is turning the diplomatic crisis into a political battle to appeal to nationalist sections of the electorate. But the crisis could have undesirable outcomes. European leaders fear that Mr. Erdogan   s outreach could help the anti-Muslim far-right parties in the continent. In the Netherlands, which went to the polls on Wednesday, the far-right candidate, Geert Wilders, has already questioned the    loyalty    of Dutch Muslims of Turkish origin and called for a tough response to Ankara. Mr. Erdogan might win short-term political dividends from this ongoing spat, but in the longer run he is endangering both Turkey   s ties with Europe and the prospects of the hundreds of thousands of Turks living in the continent. European countries could also have avoided extreme reactions, such as refusing to give landing rights to a plane carrying Turkey   s Foreign Minister. Such escalation is politically unwise, given the context in which Mr. Erdogan is running his campaign. Instead, the Netherlands and other countries could have opted for direct engagement with Ankara to avoid a showdown. After all, Turkey and Europe need each other. The EU is Turkey   s largest trading partner. And Turkey is a NATO member. Both sides will be tested on whether they can turn the focus to more positive aspects of this complicated relationship.",opinion,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/gauntlet-at-sukma/article17469378.ece,"It would be tempting, but dangerous, to see the deadly ambush by Maoists in Chhattisgarh   s Sukma district on Saturday as just a desperate act of a fading insurgent group. It must, instead, serve as a wake-up call for the security forces to beef up their standard operating procedures, especially intelligence-gathering capabilities, in the Maoist heartland in central India. Twelve personnel of the Central Reserve Police Force were killed in Sunday   s attack, and four others sustained injuries. A road-opening party of the CRPF   s 219 battalion was ambushed about 450 km from the State capital Raipur. The insurgents used improvised explosive devices, country-made mortars and arrows mounted with explosive heads, and made off with some weapons and radio sets of the force. Home Minister Rajnath Singh told the Lok Sabha that extremist groups were restless because of the    unprecedented success of the forces against them    in 2016, especially in Chhattisgarh where there was a 15% drop in left-wing extremist incidents. However, the precision and scale of the attack are an indication that the Maoists continue to hold formidable sway in Sukma, their long-time stronghold. In 2013 they ambushed a convoy of Congress leaders in Sukma district, killing more than 25 persons, including former Union Minister V.C. Shukla.There have been periodic Maoist attacks in the region. It is estimated that over the last two decades at least 15,000 people have been killed in Maoist-related violence. More than 3,000 of them were security personnel. And while violence is down from its peak in 2009-10, in 2016 official estimates put the toll at 213 civilians, 65 security force personnel and 89 Maoists. The government has over the past decade taken a patchy approach to bringing the so-called    red corridor    under its writ. The only presence of the state consistently visible across the region has been of the security forces, not of the civil administration. Counter-insurgency operations by the security forces have often been undermined by poor intelligence, flagging alertness of the security forces and the absence of a multi-layered political strategy. The Maoists do not survive merely on ideology; they have a well-oiled machinery providing protection to various interest groups in the absence of a robust state responsive to the security and welfare needs of the civilian population. Ultimately, any fight against non-state actors will be effective only when the state puts forward its combined might to exhibit what it can     and indeed must     provide to the people.",opinion,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-lost-opportunity/article17469395.ece,"On March 9, a day after International Women   s Day, Parliament cleared the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Bill. Union Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya called it his    humble gift to women.   The Bill extends the period of paid maternity leave for women working in the organised sector to 26 weeks from the current 12. This is applicable to all organisations that employ 10 or more people. Although on the face of it this is a Bill that will benefit women employees, in its implementation it is likely to adversely impact women in the workplace. The gender ratio in corporate India is already highly lopsided. In 2015, women accounted for only 21% of the jobs at the entry level to managerial position, according to a report, From Intention to Impact, published by Catalyst, a non-profit organisation. Even as HR managers strive to increase the gender diversity in their organisations, they are wary about the added costs of hiring young, fertile women. This extension of maternity leave to six months will effectively double these costs and this is likely to result in much fewer women being employed in the corporate sector.In progressive countries, at least a part of the maternity costs are borne by the government. In India, this is entirely passed on to companies. There is both a direct as well as an indirect cost to long maternity leaves.    We have to also consider that, especially when teams are small, the cost of the absentee employee is borne by other employees, not so much in money, but in terms of working additional hours to make up for the absence,    the HR head of a large organisation said.    Therefore, when we make a hiring decision, we have to think about the impact that having several young women in a team will have on the overall productivity of the team and the hidden costs that the organisation has to bear.   Also, India   s leaking pipeline     the number of women who quit their jobs between junior and middle levels     is 50%, compared to the average of 29% in Asia. This also implies that the number of women who avail their maternity benefits and yet do not resume their jobs is rather high, adding to the cost concerns of their recruiters.That said, some of the other provisions in the Bill are encouraging and if implemented well, will help young mothers stay in the workplace. For example, organisations which employ more than 30 women (or 50 people, whichever is less) will now have to provide a cr  che. The mother is allowed to visit the cr  che four times during the day. Also, mothers who adopt babies are entitled to 12 weeks of paid maternity leave.Forgotten fathersWhere the Bill fails utterly though, is in its complete negligence of the roles of fathers. Not only is this a lost opportunity to make some provisions for gender parity, it also works as a double whammy against women, by heaping all parental responsibilities exclusively on her. It further pushes the arguments of both comparative costs of hiring women versus men, as well as ties women down to the primary role of being childcare providers and not professionals in the workplace.",opinion,,
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/comparing-budgets/article17469393.ece,"What is new about the Chinese defence budget?On March 6, China announced its official defence budget for 2017. With a rise of 7%, the official spending on defence would be 1.044 trillion yuan ($151.43 billion, or about Rs. 10 lakh crore) in 2017, a spokeswoman for the National People   s Congress announced in an effort to dispel global concerns about lack of transparency in Chinese defence spending. The figure was omitted a day earlier from the annual budget report released by the Ministry of Finance. The modest budget increase was surprising, especially since President Xi Jinping, who chairs the Central Military Commission, is undertaking a comprehensive overhaul of the military to turn it into a nimble, modern force.Is the figure reliable?The officially announced figure may not fully reflect the Chinese spending in beefing up its military capabilities in both conventional and unconventional arenas. Most China observers believe that the total spending by the country is significantly more than the official budget. It is well known that much of the Chinese spending on dual-use capabilities is not accounted as military spending.Would it be instructive to compare China   s defence budget to that of the U.S.?Observers were surprised by the increase in defence spending, especially given that American President Donald Trump proposes a 10% increase in military spending, though the U.S. has wound up most of its major foreign operations, and the growing tension between the two countries. Pentagon   s budget, proposed in the last week of February, is $603 billion. While China inhabits a far more complex neighbourhood, it is nowhere near the U.S. in terms of military capabilities, expeditionary operations and strategic capabilities. However, China would also be drawing its lessons from the collapse of Soviet Union, which stretched its resources in an arms race with the U.S.What about India?For 2017-18, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has allocated Rs. 3,59,854 crore (roughly $53.5 billion) to the Ministry of Defence, which is a third of the Chinese defence budget. Some part of the Indian budget would be spent in catching up with the modern infrastructure and military capabilities across the border. However, much of New Delhi   s plans to counter China   s growing military strength is shelved already. India   s first Mountain Strike Corps, meant for China operations, is now scaled down, the IAF is struggling to meet the huge shortage of fighters, and the Navy does not even have enough capital budget to pay for committed liabilities.",opinion,,

The core problem of NPAs is with very large corporates, though few in numbers, predominantly in the steel, power, infrastructure and textile sectors. They had expanded their capacity during the boom period (2003-08), but could not face the onslaught of global financial crisis and consequent slowdown thereafter,    the Finance Minister said.The government, Mr. Jaitley said, is taking sector-specific measures to deal with bad loans and the steel sector is on the recovery path, while several decisions have been taken to help resolve problems faced in the infrastructure, power and textile sectors.A presentation was made to the MPs on various measures undertaken by the Government and the Reserve Band for tackling NPAs.

Unlike rival parties in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP did not nominate a local chief ministerial candidate to represent the party, but instead focused on the leadership of Mr. Modi himself. By contrast, the 2012 Uttar Pradesh election outcome reflected popular support for individuals in the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party,    Moody   s said in an issuer comment on Wednesday.No immediate gains   The ruling party will not immediately benefit from its electoral gains.

If the BJP-led coalition increases its seat tally to or closer to an outright majority, passage and implementation of additional reforms will be easier.

BJP president Amit Shah said the party would honour its promises.According to bankers, the Indian Banks    Association will take up the matter with the department of financial services in the finance ministry.The magnitude of the problem, if the proposal is implemented, can be seen from the fact that U.P. ranks third in India in terms of agricultural credit exposure, bankers said.The State has a 9.3% market share in agricultural credit and about 45% of its total exposure is in the rural areas. Bank of Baroda is the leading bank at the State-level and its branch network is as high as the country   s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI).Arundhati Bhattacharya, chairman, SBI, said such schemes disturb credit discipline and raise hope for more waiver by other States.   We feel that in case of a [farm] loan waiver there is always a fall in credit discipline because the people who get the waiver have expectations of future waivers as well. As such future loans given often remain unpaid,    Ms. Bhattacharya said on the sidelines of an event organised by the CII.   Today, the loans will come back as the government will pay for it but when we disburse loans again then the farmers will wait for the next election expecting another waiver,    she said.Ms. Bhattacharya, however, said the bank had not received any proposal to waive off farm loans in Uttar Pradesh. She said though it is important to support farmers it has to be done in a way which does not disrupt credit discipline among them.One-time settlementShe said SBI had announced a one-time settlement (OTS) scheme worth Rs. 6,000 crore in the tractors segment to speed up loan recovery.

And there is a presumption of approval,    Mr. Kalsi told The Hindu on the phone from New Jersey.Overlapping with the U.S. military   s new accommodation policy that will allow Sikhs, Muslims, Jews and African Americans to join its ranks has been the spate of racial crimes against them in the recent weeks. Mr. Kalsi said the campaign ran by President Trump has contributed to this.    These vicious attacks are encouraged by the current political climate in the country, running through the entire election cycle. The administration needs to speak out strongly against this,    Mr. Kalsi said.   I can guarantee you that after the changes in uniform policy, more Sikhs, more Muslims will join the military,    Mr. Kalsi said. While the proud Sikh is excited about the victory of the campaign supported by the Sikh Coalition and an array of American civil rights groups, the attacks on immigrants and minorities disturbs him.    As a six year old, my grandmother witnessed all her family members being killed in 1947, in Lahore. She came to India as an orphan, as a refugee. I always remember that and I feel bad when people are put down because they are refugees. The recent refugee ban by the Trump administration, and attacks on people of Indian descent remind me of my own grandmother   s story,    Mr. Kalsi, who came to the U.S. as toddler, said. His father was an Indian Air Force officer and he was born in the Kanpur Air Force Base.Great military heritageMr. Kalsi said it was the    great military heritage    of the Sikh community and faith that motivated him to join the U.S. Army in 2001. He went to the medical school and in the initial years, turban and beard didn   t bring any attention.   I went on medical rotation at several military bases, without any problem. When I was going to full-time active duty in 2008, I had to apply for accommodation. There began the whole campaign,    Mr. Kalsi said. His request was granted by the U.S. Secretary of Defence, and Mr. Kalsi was deployed in Helmand, Afghanistan, in 2011.Four-star general of U.S. Marine Corps John R. Allen was Mr. Kalsi   s commander in Afghanistan. In July 2016, Mr. Allen was a special speaker at the Democratic National Convention, questioning Mr. Trump   s policy towards minorities and his strategy for fighting the Islamic State. A group of veterans drawn from all ethnic and religious origins stood behind Mr. Allen, showcasing the U.S. military as the symbol of the diverse America. Mr. Kalsi stood right behind his former commander, in the frame.    These are the people who fight for America,    the general said.The current turmoil will pass, believes Mr. Kalsi, who was himself the target of a racial attack in 2001 after the 9/11 terrorist attack.    I was at a shopping mall in California and four men started abusing me. They were making fun of my turban and started hitting me. But thankfully, the cops arrived immediately and they were all arrested,    recalls Mr. Kalsi, who is now an active reserve in the U.S army. Mr. Kalsi is associated with the Truman National Security Project in Washington DC, combining his passion for matters related to national security and civil rights     a soldier for America and the Sikh faith.",international,USA,Politics

The spirit of fascism is running wild on the streets of Europe,    Mr. Erdogan said in a televised speech after clashes that followed the blocking of Turkish Ministers from giving speeches in support of reforms giving him extra powers.   The Jews were treated the same in the past,    he added, referring to the persecution of Jews under Nazi Germany, which carried out a systematic plan to annihilate Europe   s Jews in the Holocaust.    Europe is heading towards being drowned in its own fears,    Mr. Erdogan said, referring to the rise of the far right in the continent over the last years.   Turkophobia is mounting. Islamophobia is mounting. They are even scared of migrants who take shelter. They are scared of everything which is not from there, they are hostile to everything which is not from there.    The blocking of Turkish Ministers by the Dutch authorities at the weekend had been followed by protests in Rotterdam where the local police used horses and dogs to disperse the pro-Turkey protesters.The images were highlighted in the pro-government Turkey press, provoking an angry reaction.Turkey and the EU are going through their most explosive crisis after key EU members The Netherlands and Germany blocked Turkish Ministers from holding rallies to back constitutional changes expanding Mr. Erdogan   s powers.Srebrenica massacreMr. Erdogan has repeatedly accused the two countries of behaving like    Nazis   , comments that have left The Hague and Berlin aghast. Mr. Erdogan on Tuesday caused further anger by bringing up the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, where Dutch UN peacekeepers failed to prevent the killing of 8,000 Bosnian Muslims by Bosnian Serbs. On Wednesday he went further, accusing the Netherlands of massacring over 8,000 Bosnian Muslims at Srebrenica.",international,Istanbul,Others
