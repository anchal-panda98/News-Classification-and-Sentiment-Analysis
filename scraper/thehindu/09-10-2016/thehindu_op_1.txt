  <TD>Modi exploiting sacrifices of soldiers, says Rahul</TD>

  <TD>In a frontal assault on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday accused him of exploiting the sacrifices of our soldiers for political purposes, days after Indian special forces undertook surgical strikes that targeted terrorist launch pads across the Line of Control in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. In remarks reminiscent of mother Sonia Gandhi’s “khoon ka saudagar” (merchants of death) speech in Gujarat in 2007, Mr. Gandhi, addressing a public meeting here, thundered: “Jo hamare jawan hain jinhone apna khoon diya hai, Jammu and Kashmir mein khoon diya hai, jinhone Hindustan ke liye surgical strike kiye hain, unke khoon ke peeche aap chhupe hain. Unke khoon ki aap dalali kar rahe ho. Yeh bilkul galat hai” (You [Modi] are hiding behind the blood of soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir and those who carried out the surgical strikes for India. You are exploiting their sacrifices, which is very wrong.”)But along with this emotive issue, Mr. Gandhi also zeroed in on a subject that has been causing heartburn in the armed forces – the anomalies in the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations for them. “It is time you listened to the armed forces and gave them what they want as part of the Seventh Pay Commission.”The challenge to Mr. Modi came from Parliament Street, less than a kilometre away from South Block, and a stone’s throw from Jantar Mantar, the traditional hub for all anti-government protests.If the accusation that Mr. Modi was exploiting the sacrifices of our soldiers for political purposes was the climax of a 10-minute-long speech, the earlier part, too, took on the BJP-led NDA dispensation: Mr. Modi’s government had not fulfilled the BJP’s election promises, whether to deposit Rs. 15 lakh in every bank account after retrieving the black money stashed abroad, or to provide two crore jobs annually, or hike the minimum support price for farmers, he said, adding, “Clean India, Make in India, Connect India all have failed.”‘Divisive agenda’But where Mr. Modi had succeeded, Mr. Gandhi stressed, was in “dividing” the country — Jats versus non-Jats in Haryana, Patidars versus non-Patidars in Gujarat, or Hindus versus Muslims in Uttar Pradesh. “All this is harming the country,” he said, adding that what people wanted were jobs, the right prices for their crops, fair wages for labour and an enabling environment for small shopkeepers.The speech came at the end of a 3,438 km, 26-day journey that started in Deoria in eastern Uttar Pradesh and covered 141 of the 403 Assembly segments of the State. Along the way, there were 26 khat sabhas, and close to 700 meetings.Banking on loan waiverThe highlight of Mr. Gandhi’s kisan yatra was the 75 lakh loan waiver forms signed by farmers: the Congress has promised that if voted to power they will waive all agricultural loans in the State within 10 days, just as the party had done in the run-up to the 2009 Lok Sabha polls. At a time of great agricultural distress, this, the Congress believes, could be its secret weapon.The U.P. unit’s vice-president R.P.N. Singh said the party’s target is to increase the number of signed loan waiver forms to two crore by the end of October.Indeed on Thursday, Mr. Gandhi dwelt at length on the agricultural crisis in the country and of farmers whom he had met who were contemplating suicide as they were in dire straits.Addressing the party faithful from a stage on a cordoned-off stretch of Parliament Street, flanked by the party’s U.P. team, as well as central office-bearers, Mr. Gandhi also spoke of what he had learnt along his journey.The impact of Mr. Gandhi’s Deoria-Delhi yatra was also felt in the national capital as he touched several points in Delhi on his way to Parliament Street. </TD>

  <TD>A city court on Thursday asked the Delhi State Election Commission to file records relating to Union Minister Smriti Irani’s educational qualification, filed by her while contesting the 2004 general elections. The court directive was on a complaint alleging she had given false information in her affidavit.Metropolitan Magistrate Harvinder Singh, who was expected to pronounce the order on whether to summon the politician as accused in the case, directed Election Commission officials to file the documents after noting that some clarifications were required in the matter.The complainant alleged that Ms. Irani had deliberately given discrepant information about her educational qualifications in affidavits filed before the poll panel in 2004, 2011 and 2014 and not given any clarification despite concerns raised on the issue. </TD>

  <TD>Won’t prejudge Vemula’s Dalit status: Javadekar</TD>

</TD>
  <TD>Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar skirted a question whether the commission probing Hyderabad University student Rohith Vemula’s death had said he was not a Dalit. He said his officials were yet to brief him about the contents of the report.Instead, he said the government would devise grievance redress mechanisms to ensure that students were not led to taking extreme steps in universities. The Ministry would ensure that such mechanisms were in place across Central universities. “I will not prejudge the case until I am briefed by officials on the committee report,” Mr. Javadekar told The Hindu here. He was answering questions after meeting 36 Vice-Chancellors from central universities at the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) on Thursday.The question whether Vemula was a Dalit had been raging for months. Social Justice Minister Thawarchand Gehlot had, in an interview to The Hindu, said he was not a Dalit, while SC Commission chairman P.L. Punia insisted he was. Mr. Javadekar said the Justice Roopanwal Committee had recommended strengthening and formalising mechanisms to ensure that students did not slip into depression and resort to “extreme steps.” There should be orientation programmes in all institutions. This could be three to seven days long or even extend to a few weeks. For a support system to work, there must be a good relationship between seniors and juniors. There should be a proper mechanism for counselling. And there must be a grievance redress system as well, he said. </TD>

</TD>
  <TD>Veteran athletics coach V.R. Beedu will not receive the Department of Youth Empowerment and Sports (DYES) Lifetime Achievement Award, despite getting the nod from the award selection committee members.Former international athlete Uday Prabhu, a member of the selection committee, said, “Mr. Beedu’s name was on top of our list. He was our unanimous choice. We are shocked. If Department of Youth Empowerment and Sports is intent on making its own decisions, then what is the need for a selection committee?”Retired sportspersons Syed Kirmani (committee chief and former cricketer), Suma Shirur (shooter), A.B. Subbaiah (hockey) and Elvira Britto (hockey) are the other panel members. John Christopher (swimming) and R. Shivanand (wrestling) have been selected for the honour, which will be bestowed upon them at a function in Mysuru on Friday. Mr. Beedu (69), who has imparted fitness training not only to track and field athletes, but also to celebrated cricketers like Kapil Dev, Anil Kumble and Rahul Dravid, took it on the chin.“A few days ago, I was told by Kirmani and Prabhu that they had recommended my name. This has come as a surprise, but I’m not disappointed. Life goes on,” said Mr. Beedu, whose coaching career is now into its fifth decade.A miffed N. Chandrashekar Rai, Honourary Secretary, Karnataka Athletics Association, demanded an inquiry and threatened to take the matter to court. “Mr. Beedu has spent more time as a coach than the entire life span of the two award winners,” Mr. Rai remarked.When contacted, DYES Joint Director M.S. Ramesh refused to comment.</TD>

  <TD>A lorry and a bus were seized after they were found bearing fake number plates — interchanging number plates of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu —during checks by the Transport Department here on Thursday.Following tensions between the two States over the Cauvery river water sharing row, many vehicles have been changing their number plates at the border for “security” reasons post the September 12 violence in the city. On Thursday, a private bus – originally with a Tamil Nadu number plate – was found in the State under a false Karnataka number plate. Similarly, a lorry– originally with a Karnataka number plate was found attempting to enter Tamil Nadu with a fake T.N. plate.Over 600 vehicles were checked for violations, including plying without permits or emission certificates or insurances, by special squads of the Transport Department near Jigani Cross, Nice Road, Bennerghatta Road and surrounding areas.A total of 100 vehicles were booked, and 50 seized, said officials.A T.N. bus with a Karnataka number plate and a Karntaka lorry with a T.N. registration were seizedA T.N. bus with a Karnataka number plate and a Karntaka lorry with a T.N. registration were seized</TD>

</TD>
  <TD>The Karnataka State Human Rights Commission on Thursday issued a notice to city Police Commissioner N.S. Megharikh and sought a report over allegations of harassment of transgenders in the city.The notice was issued following a complaint by the community members to the commission on Wednesday. In their complaint, members alleged that the police had launched a witchhunt after a Kannada news channel aired a “sting” operation on the alleged forced castration of an 18-year-old boy.Akkai Padmashali from the community said six transgenders had been arrested by police and they have been remanded in judicial custody in connection with the case. “Though all the six are women, they have been placed in the men’s barracks where they are being humiliated. They are sick and need immediate treatment. Meanwhile, in the garb of investigation, the police are barging into the homes of many other transgenders too, which has terrified the community,” she said. Meera Saksena, chairperson, KSHRC, said that further directions would be issued to the city police after an inquiry into the incident. “We have sought a report from the Commissioner. Let him submit his report. We will look into the issue, probe if any human rights were violated and take necessary action,” she said.The transgender community is planning a rally on October 21, to protest the harassment by the police and a section of the media.</TD>

  <TD>Lagarde warns against retreat from globalisation</TD>

  <TD>http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/lagarde-warns-against-retreat-from-globalisation/article9193268.ece?w=alauto
</TD>
  <TD>Expressing disappointment over the “persistent underperformance” of world economy, IMF chief Christine Lagarde on Thursday called for greater trade integration and warned against retreat from globalisation and multilateralism.“A retreat from globalisation and multilateralism is a serious risk at a time when international cooperation and coordination are as critical as ever,” the Managing Director said in her global policy agenda as the annual fall meeting of the IMF and the World bank kicked off here.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is leading the Indian delegation to the IMF and World Bank meetings.Despite signs of recovery and resilience in some economies, global growth continues to disappoint, with the expected pick-up driven primarily by emerging markets, Ms. Lagarde said in her policy paper.“This persistent underperformance has exposed complex underlying trends in many countries — including the difficulty for some groups to adjust to rapid changes in the global economy,” she noted.Ms. Lagarde said that policymakers should therefore act and use a balanced mix of all policy levers to revive demand and raise productivity, and ensure the gains from technology and globalisation — which have led to unprecedented global welfare gains in recent decades — are shared more broadly.Ms. Lagarde said in many advanced economies, demand is low with the post—crisis recovery being uneven across countries, and output gaps are still negative.Productivity growth has not recovered, and while the reasons are not fully understood, it is likely owing to several factors that hinder investment, including debt overhangs, and low and uncertain prospects of future demand.“Emerging economy growth improved overall, driven by robust activity in emerging Asia and large stressed economies showing some signs of improvement. Yet vulnerabilities, especially in the corporate sector of some large countries, have persisted,” she said.The IMF chief argued that global economy has benefited tremendously from globalisation and technological change, particularly with regard to expanding consumers’ access to goods and services and helping to lift millions out of poverty in EMDCs (Emerging Markets and Developing Countries).With hindsight, not enough has been done to address the concerns of those who have been adversely affected, creating social tensions and political backlash, she said, adding that this has added to a political climate that favours inward-looking policies, makes reforms more difficult to enact, and puts at risk the well-established overall gains in productivity from globalisation and technological change.Lagarde said she felt that multilateral agreements with broad participation are difficult in an increasingly multi-polar world, but the gains from them are large.</TD>

  <TD>44 Afghan troops missing from U.S. training mission</TD>

  <TD>http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/44-afghan-troops-missing-from-us-training-mission/article9193581.ece?w=alauto
</TD>
  <TD>Forty-four Afghan troops visiting the United States for military training have gone missing in less than two years, presumably in an effort to live and work illegally in America, Pentagon officials said.Although the number of disappearances is relatively small — some 2,200 Afghan troops have received military training in the United States since 2007 — the incidents raise questions about security and screening procedures for the programmes.They are also potentially embarrassing for U.S. President Barack Obama’s administration, which has spent billions of dollars training Afghan troops as Washington seeks to extricate itself from the costly, 15-year-old war. The disclosure could fuel criticism by supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has accused the Obama administration of failing to properly vet immigrants from Muslim-majority countries and has pledged a much tougher stance if he wins.While other foreign troops on U.S. military training visits have sometimes run away, a U.S. defence official said that the frequency of Afghan troops going missing was concerning and “out of the ordinary.”Since September alone, eight Afghan troops have left military bases without authorisation, Pentagon spokesman Adam Stump said. — Reuters</TD>

  <TD>ISL: Dynamos rattle Chennaiyin in its den</TD>

</TD>
  <TD>It was a soothing evening for Gianluca Zambrotta, anything but for Marco Materazzi.Delhi Dynamos showed the value of patience as it attacked in packs to rattle the Chennaiyin FC defence while the home side paid the price for a lack of cutting edge in the final third.But the home side was the better side in the initial exchanges with its players overloading the left-hand side to attack Dynamos’s weak-link Souvik Chakraborty.In the eighth minute, a teasing cross from left-back Nallapan Mohanraj found Dudu Omagbemi, but the Nigerian headed it out.There were couple of crosses from the flanks and good slick movements into the box by Chennaiyin, but there was cohesion in the Dynamos’s back four, thwarting all danger.Dynamos coach Zambrotta instructed his players from the touchline to focus on Chennaiyin midfield generals Raphael Augusto and Hans Mulder, who were excellent in motoring forward with or without the ball.The visitors took time to settle down, absorbing all the pressure. Their moment came in the 24th minute when a quick counter-attack caught Chennaiyin stranded on the half-line.An exquisite long ball from Emerson Gomes into the box found Milan Singh. Chennaiyin goalkeeper Duwayne Kerr, who was already under scrutiny for a couple of mis-passes and pathetic distribution, rushed forward to collect the ball but pushed Milan Singh. The referee enforced the strict rule of law, pointing to the spot.Marcelinho sent Kerr the wrong way to put Dynamos ahead in the 26th minute.The equaliser didn’t take much time to come with Augusto in the forefront. The Brazilian initiated the attack with a sublime through ball to Jeje Lalpekhlua, who set up Dudu in the 32nd minute.Dynamos regrouped and punished Chennaiyin for slackness after the goal with Richard Gadze assisting Marcelinho for his and the team’s second in the 34th.Dynamos were not in a hurry for the third, as they defended in two banks of four to see out the first half.The game was finely poised as everyone thought there was an interesting second-half to be dished out.But Chennaiyin struggled to formulate a response with its forwards either losing the balls in promising positions or missing the intended target.Dynamos sat compact at the back and even allowed Chennaiyin to have the ball. Materazzi made all three tactical substitutions by the 72nd minute but none of them worked.But Zambrotta was spot on in his substitution when he replaced the hard-working Gadze with Badara Badji in the 75th. The Senagal player put the game to the bed in the 84th when Kean Lewis, easily the best Dynamos player, sent a precise ball in the box.Materazzi, who made one change to the squad bringing in Dudu Omagbemi in place of Davide Succi, is already feeling the pinch without the services of Elano Blumer and John Stiven Mendoza.</TD>
