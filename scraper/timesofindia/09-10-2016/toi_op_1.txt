  <TD>ISLAMABAD: Pakistani daily Dawn's report on the "discussions" at a recent high-level huddle of top civilian and military leaders+ , rejected by the Nawaz Sharif government+ , created palaver across the country on Thursday. The lack of substance in government clarification, issued twice with changes, only indicated the degree of the military's unhappiness with the report, sources said. The word 'half-truth' in the original statement, describing the contents of the newspaper report, was replaced with 'fabrication' in the revised version. The clarification also had a paragraph absolving the Army and the ISI in clear terms -- under duress or afterthought? "The (Dawn) story only confirms poor civil-military relations in an opaque political system where the military+ wields influence over foreign policy," Hussain Haqqani, Pakistan's former ambassador to the US, told TOI . "It's good that civilians realize Pakistan's isolation. It's bad that some do not see how Pakistan is risking its global position by not acting against internationally designated terrorists. I hope our military leaders also would want action against those deemed terrorists by the world. Positive relations with India would be in Pakistan's interest," Haqqani added. Aitzaz Ahsan, a PPP stalwart and ex-home minister, said the reason for Pakistan's isolation+ is that it gives freedom to non-state actors. "The government has been completely unsuccessful in imposing restrictions on non-state actors. Just saying that we believe Pakistan has no hand in the Uri attack is not a categorical denial. It implies that we don't know if our non-state actors are behind it,"Aitzaz said. London-based analyst Amir Ghauri said, "Nawaz is attempting a triple win - action against religious hardliners; gain a few inches of political space lost to military in the last three years; and cement his political credentials," Ghauri said. "India would love to see a civil-military confrontation escalate in Pakistan to ease domestic and international pressure due to Kashmir uprising. By accusing Pakistan of backing groups like Jaish-e-Mohammad+ (JeM) or Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD), and by pulling out of the SAARC summit+ , India might have forced Pakistan's hand a little, but I think Sharif and not Modi may prove to be gaining the most from this situation," Ghauri added. Senior journalist Rahimullah Yousafzai said JeM's Maulana Masood Azhar has not made any public statement for long, but the government appears to have made up its mind to control the activities of JuD and its chief leader Hafiz Muhammad Saeed. Saleem Sethi, an analyst, said the Dawn report seemed a calculated move. With Gen Sharif retiring at November-end, the PM thinks it's the best time to assert himself and tilt the balance in favour of civilian rule, he said.

  <TD>LES CAYES: Hurricane Matthew has killed at least 283 people in Haiti, including dozens in one coastal town that authorities and rescue workers were only beginning to reach days after the powerful storm, officials said on Thursday. The Interior Ministry, a mayor and other local officials confirmed the numbers across Haiti to Reuters, with many victims killed by falling trees, flying debris and swollen rivers when Matthew hit with 230 kmph winds on Tuesday. Haiti's civil protection service has so far put the toll in the impoverished Caribbean nation at 108 dead. Most of the fatalities were in towns and fishing villages around the western end of Tiburon peninsula in the country's southwest, one of Haiti's most picturesque regions. The storm passed directly through the peninsula, driving the sea inland and flattening homes on Monday and Tuesday. "Several dozen" died in the coastal town of Les Anglais in Sud Department, said Louis Paul Raphael, the central government's representative in the region. "I've never seen anything like this," said Raphael. Les Anglais was the first to be hit by Matthew and has been out of contact since then. Just before the storm hit, the mayor told Reuters people were fleeing their houses in panic as the sea surged into town. A few miles south in Port-a-Piment village Mayor Jean-Raymond Pierre-Louis said 25 people died. Further south still, in the village of Roche-a-Bateau, 24 died. In Grand Anse Department, also on the storm's destructive path but on the other side of the peninsula, 38 more lost their lives. Along with the human devastation, the storm killed livestock . In one public hospital in Les Cayes, a port town on the Tiburon peninsula, most doctors had not shown up to work since they took shelter as the storm hit. Food and water was scarce in shelters. The devastation in Haiti prompted authorities to postpone a presidential election scheduled for Sunday. Poverty, weak government and precarious living conditions for many of its citizens make Haiti particularly vulnerable to natural disasters. In 2010, a magnitude 7 earthquake wrecked the capital Port-au-Prince, killing upwards of 200,000 people. In the earthquake's wake, UN peace keepers inadvertently introduced cholera to the country, killing at least 9,000 and infecting hundreds of thousands more. The Pan American Health Organization said on Thursday it was preparing for a possible cholera surge in Haiti after the hurricane because the flooding was likely to contaminate water supplies. In Les Cayes' tiny airport, windows were blown out and the terminal roof was mostly missing although the landing strip was not heavily damaged. "The runway is working. In the hours and days to come we can receive humanitarian flights," said Sergot Tilis, the information officer and runway agent for the airport. Matthew is the strongest hurricane in the Caribbean since Felix in 2007 and was moving toward Florida as a Category 4 cyclone, the second strongest on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. Four people were killed over the weekend in the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.</TD>

  <TD>The Ro Test: An Indian-American Congressman for Silicon Valley could be a new milestone</TD>
  <TD>Chidanand Rajghatta</TD>
  <TD>http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/us-canada-news/The-Ro-Test-An-Indian-American-Congressman-for-Silicon-Valley-could-be-a-new-milestone/articleshow/54726388.cms
</TD>
  <TD>WASHINGTON: First Indian-American Congressman. First Indian-American Governor. First Indian-American CEO of a Fortune100 company. First Indian-American District Attorney. First Indian-American federal judge. First Indian-American ambassador. First Indian-American Surgeon General. First Indian-American White House CTO. First Indian-American Presidential candidate. Milestones for the Indian diaspora in the US have been ticked off rapidly over the years as the community has gone from strength to strength in terms of education, income, professional excellence, and influence. But in what could be a landmark achievement even for community used to such breakthrough moments, a young Indian-American Democrat is poised to win a congressional seat in the heart of Silicon Valley, the Ground Zero of technology that many Indians feel is their home turf in many ways. "Wouldn't that be cool? The Indian-American son of an IIT engineer and a school teacher representing Silicon Valley? It really will mark the political arrival of the community in a very special way!" chuckles Ro (Rohit) Khanna, 39, who currently holds six point lead in California's 17th Congressional District against incumbent Mike Honda, a 74-year old Japanese-American lawmaker who has represented the constituency for eight terms. The 17th district, encompassing the cities of Sunnyvale, Cupertino, Santa Clara, Fremont, Newark, North San Jose, and Milpitas, is unique in several ways. Not only does it have the cream of American tech companies - Apple, Google, Yahoo, Intel, EBay and Cisco among them - it is said to be the only Asian-American majority constituency in Continental United States. It is also home to probably the largest concentration of "desi" population in the US., -- upwards of 25,000 or about ten per cent of the electorate, according to Khanna. Median household income in the district tops $ 100,000, making it one of the richest political districts in US. No surprise here: Indian-Americans are THE wealthiest demographic in America. And many of them - Asian-Americans, desis, and tech giants -- have Khanna's back this time after he narrowly lost to Honda in 2014. Among those who have endorsed Khanna: Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, Google's Sundar Pichai, Kleiner Perkins' John Doerr, browser pioneer Marc Andreesen, and venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, who's holding a fund-raiser for him later this month. It is a formidable tech phalanx, but Khanna is not resting easy on their support alone or his six-point lead, which as Hillary Clinton finds out often, can evaporate quickly. Honda is a formidable opponent who beat him (51.8-48.2) in 2014 despite similar support and impressive financial clout that brought Khanna within three points of an upset. But this time Khanna thinks he has the measure of Honda, in part because of an impressive new ally - spouse Ritu Ahuja, after the two married in 2015. "She's the big difference between 2014 and now...she's the game-changer!" he exulted in an interview. "She's incredible with people and a huge asset." There's another big change from 2014. Like Khanna, who is a former commerce department official and an attorney, Honda is also a Democrat, albeit an old school one who suffers from the incumbent handicap in a country seething for change. California rules mandate the top two finishers in the primary's to face-off and Khanna surprised Honda in the intra-party race, defeating him by two points. In the meantime, Honda also lost the support of President Obama because of an ethics investigation, although he still has the backing of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senator Dianne Feinstein, and other political heavies. All this puts Khanna in a favorable position for the November 8 election, although he's not counting his votes, much less his seat in the House of Representatives, yet. "We still need our constituents to come out and vote. I need a big turnout from my supporters," he said. "This is history being made." Khanna could also be one of several Indian-Americans to make it to Capitol Hill in November after years of solo representation for the community that began with Dalip Singh Saund's election to the House in 1952. The sole flagbearer in the current house is Ami Bera, who faces a tough re-election, in California's 7th Congressional district around Sacramento. The big shoo-in in California appears to be Kamala Harris, strongly tipped to succeed Barbara Boxer's seat in the US Senate, which would make her the first Senator of Indian-origin. Pramila Jayapal in the 7th district of Washington State, Raja Krishnamoorthi in Illinois's 8th district, and Peter Jacob in New Jersey's 7th district are among those running for the House of Representatives. All terrific, the way Ro Khanna sees it; but few victories can resonate as well for the Indian-American community as one of their own representing Silicon Valley.Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.</TD>

  <TD>Avoid emergency landings in Pakistan: Indian airlines issue advisory</TD>

  <TD>http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Avoid-emergency-landings-in-Pak-Indian-airlines/articleshow/54727003.cms
</TD>
  <TD>NEW DELHI: Indian carriers have asked their pilots operating flights that overfly Pakistan to avoid landing there in an emergency situation. Unless there is an "extreme emergency", like fire on board, airlines have 'informally' told pilots to opt for Muscat or UAE flight information region on westbound flights, or head to Delhi, Mumbai or Ahmedabad on India-bound flights. "Flight despatchers are asking that Pakistani airports be avoided for emergency landings if possible. These instructions have not come in writing but verbally. Making an emergency landing in Pakistan is the last resort for us in an extreme emergency," said a senior pilot with a leading Indian carrier who regularly operates international flights. Confirming this, a senior commander of another big Indian airline said that such 'informal' instructions have been issued in the past too whenever relations with Pakistan have deteriorated, like after the Kandahar hijacking, 9/11 and 26/11. Sources said that for west-bound flights, the closest 'preferable' emergency landing airports are in Muscat and UAE, like Dubai, Sharjah or Abu Dhabi. "Iran and Afghanistan, though the immediate neighbours of Pakistan, are considered 'less of an alternative'," said a route planner with a leading Indian carrier. In case of the common occurrence of pressurisation failure, for instance, overhead oxygen masks drop.These have oxygen to allow passengers to breathe for 1015 minutes. That is sufficient time for aircraft to descend from their cruising altitude, which is about 30,000ft, to 10,000ft, where oxygen is available and can be pumped into the plane through the AC ducts and "Ram air". Such planes can then keep flying at the lower altitude to make their way to an alternative airport. Almost all flights from northcentral and east India to and from Gulf, Europe and America fly over Pakistan. While even in aviation ties, the Narendra Modi government has been showing utmost restraint, Pakistan has been constantly imposing restrictions on its airspace and increasing the scope of the same, which has now required Indian carriers overflying it to make changes on some of their international flights.Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.</TD>

</TD>
  <TD>NEW DELHI: Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe called for deeper economic engagement with India and proposed stronger trade and economic linkages with south Indian states. "There can be diverse economic models around India. India is a regional power. We have much in common with south Indian states. We are looking at bilateral agreements with deeper integration and carving special trade areas with southern states of India," he told reporters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum's India economic summit on Thursday. He said his country was forging stronger economic ties with Singapore and proposed a trilateral arrangement with India to boost trade. Wickremesinghe said as far as Saarc was concerned, the level of economic activity was low and there was virtually no integration in the south Asian subcontinent. "Sri Lanka is pursuing a bilateral approach to forge greater trade and economic ties," he added. Wickremesinghe also complimented PM Modi for the "restrained and far sighted leadership" in the wake of tension between India and Pakistan. Earlier, in his address at the summit, he said Sri Lanka and India were working to expand the India-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement to include services and investment as well. " The Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement, which has been under negotiation between the two countries, should be concluded by the end of the year," he added. Wickremesinghe said as these agreements come into force, India would have access to not just the Sri Lankan market but also to markets in Singapore, Japan and China among others as the island nation was in the process of negotiating free trade pacts with several countries. He also invited Indian companies to invest in Sri Lanka, especially in areas such as infrastructure.

</TD>
  <TD>CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa, who was admitted to Apollo Hospitals+ in Chennai a fortnight ago, continues to remain on respiratory support but is "improving and making gradual progress," said a press release issued by the hospital on Thursday evening. A team of doctors, including experts from the All India Institute of Medical Science+ , New Delhi, and international specialist Dr Richard John Beale from the London Bridge Hospital, UK, along with a panel of doctors consisting intensivists, cardiologists, respiratory physicians, infectious disease specialists and diabetologists at the hospital, drew up a detailed medical management plan keeping in view of her diabetes and winter bronchitis in inclement weather. Detailed lab and radiology investigations are continuously carried out by the panel of doctors. While she continues to be on respiratory support, the present line of treatment includes antibiotics, nebulisation, drugs to decongest the lungs, nutrition, general nursing care and supportive therapy. "The consensus of opinion of all the experts is that the line of treatment given to the chief minister should be continued and she would require a longer stay," the release signed by hospital chief operating officer Subbiah Viswanathan said. Jayalalithaa was admitted to hospital on September 22 with complaints of "fever and dehydration". On Monday, the hospital said she was on respiratory support and was being treated with antibiotics for infection. On Wednesday, pulmonologist Dr G Khilnani, anaesthetist Dr Anjan Trikha and cardiologist Dr Nitish Naik discussed treatment protocols given by the specialists' team at the hospital. The team concurred with the line of treatment and would continue to stay in the hospital till Friday, Viswanathan said. Dr Beale, who earlier examined chief minister on September 30, examined her again on Thursday. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.</TD>

  <TD>QUESTION: I fought with my parents and everyone around me to marry this person. But today I regret my decision. I was so busy fighting with others to protect him that I overlooked so many things that makes him wrong for me. He doesn't respect me. He threatens me to leave his house every time we have an argument. In the past 6 months, he has even hit me twice. I don't even have a support system to go back to. I even quit my job to be with him. I don't want to hear 'I told you so' from anyone because I am already feeling like a loser right now. ANSWER BY SREEJITA: It is evident from the situation that much hurt and pain are flowing inside. Marriage is not only being in a commitment or relationship, it's also about expectations and dreams and life as we see it. When someone especially the woman gets devalued or disrespected in a marriage, it puts a question on her identity, as women tend to form a new identity on the basis of the marriage. As much as it is true that we value our relationships a lot, it should never be at the cost of our good being and self-respect. A person who threatens to leave at every argument is someone who is not ready to face life and take responsibility. When someone resorts to abuse, it shows his own vulnerability and inability to tackle the situation effectively. At such a point, there are 2 courses of action that can be followed here. First, taking care of your own well-being and fixing focus on the self and trying to communicate with your husband The first point here entails both the physical as well as the psychological well-being. The primary thing to be noted here is stated in the problem, 'I feel like a loser right now'. When a marital relationship goes awry, we often tend to find the faults, either of ourselves or our partners. We should remember that blame game does not produce any productive result. Therefore, here are some tips for the wellness of the self. - Do not live with abuse, no matter what. Abuse can be mental or physical. Verbal or mental abuse is no less than a hit with the hand, and it should be treated likewise. - Do not look for the faults. The question is not 'who was wrong', it is rather 'what went wrong and what can be done about it.' - Do not feel guilty when you know you are not at fault. Guilt traps the rational and logical thoughts and does not allow us to perform rationally. - When someone criticises you, it is not your character certificate. It is someone else's opinion, and you are free to accept it or discard it. - Spend some time with yourself, just for yourself. If you have a job, focus on it not as an escape from the home situation, but as something you love to do and is good at. - If you do not have a job, take up a hobby. It might be reading or writing creatively in a diary. Vent out the bubbling emotions on a page, it makes you feel lighter. - Take up brisk walking once or twice a day. Light exercises or medication are good as well. - Eat properly and take rest. Listen to some soothing instrumental music just before you sleep, it helps to soothe the edgy nerves. For the second part, we often get unintentionally critical at times. Criticism, although necessary up to a point, creates miscommunication and kills the relationship. Instead of saying "why didn't you do it" or "you can't do such a simple thing", what can be said is, "I was sure you could take care of it, so I was just surprised when it didn't happen." Instead of saying "you should be with these people," you can say "I feel they are not good people to be with, but then this is my opinion. You're free to accept it or discard it." this will come to him as a neutral opinion and not as an instruction, which might make him more open to him. Try talking to a marriage counselor regarding the issue. It works in both single as well as couple sessions. Even if your husband is not ready for it, you can always seek professional help for yourself. It helps you to get guidance from a neutral person and speak freely without being judged. A failed relationship seems as the end of the life, for the investment it has been and the toll it takes. But it is not always true. Life is surely not a single point focus, and when one door closes, another does open. Look for the opening. It might just be a beginning.

  <TD>Courts reject challenges to coal block auctions</TD>
  <TD>Sanjay Dutta</TD>
  <TD>http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Courts-reject-challenges-to-coal-block-auctions/articleshow/54725873.cms
</TD>
  <TD>NEW DELHI: The Narendra Modi government's auction of coal blocks continues to notch up legal victory in case after case, with the Delhi high court rejecting separate petitions by four bidders challenging classification of mines for bidding. In its order passed on Wednesday, a bench of Justices Badar Durrez Ahmed and Sanjeev Sachdeva dismissed petitions by Monnet Ispat and Energy Ltd, Jayaswal Neco Industries Ltd, Utkal Coal Ltd and Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd challenging specific end-use set for the blocks. This is the latest round of vindication for the auctions. The government has won all the nine cases in which the HCs have given verdict on petitions disputing provisions of the auction or their interpretation by the coal ministry. The positive legal outcomes also vindicate the government's arguments framed by additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain. The nine favourable verdicts come in the backdrop of 35 cases being disposed of by the courts, either dismissing the petitions or the petitioners deciding against pursuing their case. The outcome in the nine cases as well as the observations of courts in several other cases also indicate the robustness and efficiency of the e-auction process and stands in marked contrast to the federal auditor's comments to the contrary. The Comptroller and Auditor General's report on e-auction of coal blocks, tabled in Parliament on July 26, found fault with the process and said allowing corporate houses to submit multiple bids through joint ventures and group subsidiaries could have affected competition. The CAG's comment is in contrast to the Delhi HC's observation - incorporated in the federal auditor's report - in the petition filed by Sarda Energy and Minerals Ltd, challenging the provision for multiple bids in the first two rounds of block auctions. While dismissing the petition, the court said the (e-auction) "process is neither arbitrary nor irrational or designed to favour any particular bidder. It appears that the methodology adopted by the respondents for conducting the auctions in the manner by first asking for initial price offer and then conducting an electronic auction of technically qualified bidders is working well".
